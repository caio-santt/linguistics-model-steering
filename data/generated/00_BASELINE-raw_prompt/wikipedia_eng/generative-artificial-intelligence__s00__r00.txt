The analysis of the novel *Eugene Onegin* revealed that the frequency of certain letter combinations could be predicted with a modest degree of accuracy, a result that foreshadowed the later use of probabilistic models in natural language processing. While Markov’s work was primarily theoretical, it laid the groundwork for later statistical approaches to language modeling that would become central to generative AI.

In the 1950s and 1960s, researchers at institutions such as MIT and the University of California, Berkeley began experimenting with rule‑based systems that could generate simple sentences. These early attempts were constrained by limited computational resources and the lack of large corpora, but they demonstrated the feasibility of automatic text generation. One notable example was the ELIZA program (Weizenbaum, 1966), which used pattern matching and substitution to simulate a psychotherapist. Although ELIZA did not generate novel content in a statistical sense, it introduced the idea that a computer could produce human‑like dialogue, a concept that would later be refined by generative models.

The 1980s saw the emergence of neural network approaches to language modeling. The introduction of the back‑propagation algorithm allowed multilayer perceptrons to learn from data, and researchers began training networks on small text corpora to predict the next word in a sequence. These models were still rudimentary; they suffered from overfitting and required careful regularization. Nonetheless, they represented a shift from symbolic rule‑based systems toward data‑driven learning.

A major turning point came in the early 2000s with the development of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and, later, long short‑term memory (LSTM) networks. LSTMs were able to capture longer dependencies in sequences, enabling the generation of more coherent paragraphs. Pioneering work by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber (1997) and subsequent applications in machine translation and speech synthesis underscored the potential of neural networks for generative tasks. Despite these advances, the scale of the models remained modest, and the quality of generated text was still limited by the size of the training datasets.

The advent of deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch in the 2010s accelerated the development of larger models. The introduction of the transformer architecture by Vaswani et al. (2017) marked a watershed moment. Transformers eschewed recurrence in favor of self‑attention mechanisms, allowing parallel training on massive datasets and capturing long‑range dependencies more efficiently. This architecture became the backbone of many subsequent generative models, including BERT, GPT‑2, and GPT‑3, each successive iteration featuring a larger number of parameters and a broader training corpus.

The release of GPT‑3 in 2020, with its 175 billion parameters, demonstrated that generative models could produce surprisingly fluent and contextually appropriate text across a wide range of prompts.
