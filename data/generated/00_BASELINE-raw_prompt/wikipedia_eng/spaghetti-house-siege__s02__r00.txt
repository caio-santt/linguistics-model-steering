Davies, Dick and Munroe were sentenced to 22 years in prison, a sentence that was later reduced on appeal to 18 years on the grounds of a procedural error in the original trial. The judge, Mervyn Griffith‑Jones, pronounced that “the law must be upheld, but the humanity of the defendants must also be considered.” The three men were immediately transferred to HMP Brixton, where they were placed in the maximum‑security wing due to the nature of their offence and the high profile of the case.

Within the first weeks of incarceration, Davies began a series of written appeals to his brother, Thomas, who had lived in Leeds. The letters were terse, filled with a mixture of defiance and despair. “I am not a criminal, I am a revolutionary,” he wrote, “the law is a tool of the privileged, and I have been forced to act against the system that has oppressed us for generations.” The letters were read by prison officers and later, after the case had gone to the Court of Appeal, they were published in the *London Evening Standard* under the headline “The Black Revolutionary.” [ 47 ]

Dick, meanwhile, adopted a more conciliatory tone. He wrote to the court’s solicitor, offering to cooperate in exchange for a reduced sentence. “I have learned from my mistakes,” he claimed, “and I am willing to help the authorities in any way that may be useful.” The authorities, however, remained skeptical of his motives. The prison psychologist, Dr. Elena Moretti, observed that Dick’s behavior was consistent with a “recalcitrant identity, but with a latent desire for redemption.” [ 48 ]

Munroe, the youngest of the trio, was the most silent. He spent most of his time in the prison library, reading texts on Marxist theory and the history of the anti‑colonial movements. He was found by a prison guard one evening, sitting on the floor with a notebook, scribbling in a language that the guard could not decipher. When questioned, Munroe simply said, “I write to remember.” [ 49 ]

During the summer of 1977, a small group of activists, including members of the Black Panther movement in the UK, staged a protest outside Brixton prison. They carried placards that read “Free Davies, Dick, Munroe – Freedom for the Oppressed.” The protest was met with a heavy police presence, and a few demonstrators were arrested on charges of unlawful assembly. The incident was covered by the *Daily Mirror*, which ran a front‑page photo of a group of young black men being led away in handcuffs, with the caption, “Revolutionaries in Chains.”
