The sentencing was delivered with a measured gravity that seemed to echo the weight of the night itself. Judge Griffith‑Jones, who had already expressed his disquiet at the defendants’ refusal to engage with the court, pronounced that Davies, Dick and Munroe would each receive twenty‑two years in prison, the maximum penalty for robbery with violence. He added that the sentence would be served consecutively with any other convictions that might arise from the same offence. “This is a crime of violence against innocent people,” the judge said, “and the law must be upheld.”

The judge’s remarks were broadcast on local radio, and the headlines that followed reflected the public’s ambivalence. Some saw the sentence as a necessary deterrent, while others, especially within the black community, saw it as a continuation of a punitive system that had historically targeted them. The newspaper editorials that day ranged from calls for reform to calls for the judge’s resignation, and the debate spilled over into the streets, where a small group of activists gathered outside the courthouse to demand a review of the case.

The defendants’ legal counsel, who had been present during the trial, filed an appeal on the grounds that the judge had misinterpreted the law and that the defendants had been denied a fair trial. The appeal was scheduled for the following month, but the court’s docket was already full, and the case was slated to remain pending until the end of the year. In the meantime, the defendants remained in custody, their days marked by the routine of prison life: waking at dawn, receiving their meals, and attending the mandatory educational classes.

During this period, Davies’s hunger strike drew the attention of the prison’s medical staff. He had begun the strike a month after his remand, a protest against what he described as “the injustice of the state.” The prison doctor, who had been assigned to monitor his health, reported that Davies’s weight had fallen by twenty kilograms, and his blood pressure had dipped to dangerously low levels. The prison authorities, in consultation with the court, decided to force-feed him, citing the legal precedent that a person’s right to life supersedes their right to self‑determine their health. The force‑feeding was carried out under the supervision of a medical team, and Davies’s condition stabilized, though he remained in a state of chronic fatigue.

One of the hostages, Giovanni Scrano, who had been present during the siege and had developed an unlikely bond with Davies, visited him on a scheduled basis. Scrano, who had been a clerk at the restaurant before the robbery, had become a reluctant confidant to the man who had taken him hostage.
