At the close of the third morning, the officers on the perimeter had begun to adjust their strategy. Rather than continuing the static blockade, the Metropolitan Police had brought in a specialist negotiation unit from the Counter‑Criminals Group, who had previously handled high‑risk hostage situations in the United Kingdom. The negotiators, led by a seasoned officer with a background in civil‑rights disputes, attempted to appeal to the men’s ideological convictions by referencing the BLF’s stated commitment to non‑violence and the broader anti‑racism movement. They also reiterated that the police were prepared to consider the men’s demands if they could be met without further bloodshed. [31]

On the fourth day, one of the hostages—an accountant named Harold Thompson—was found unconscious in a back room, a result of the prolonged stress and lack of adequate medical care. The police, following protocol, allowed the negotiator to escort Thompson to a nearby ambulance station, where he received emergency treatment. The act of releasing a hostage under medical distress was seen by some as a strategic move to demonstrate goodwill, but the men’s representatives dismissed it as a “tactic to lower morale” among the hostages.

In the early afternoon, a new demand was put forward by the men: the release of a political prisoner named Marcus “Jah” Williams, who had been imprisoned on charges of possession of a firearm, a conviction that many in the Black community viewed as politically motivated. The police, citing the lack of any evidence that Williams had committed an armed crime, refused the request. Instead, they offered to convene a public hearing on the matter, which the men’s representatives declined, insisting that the hearing would be a “token gesture” that would not address the underlying grievances. [33]

Meanwhile, the police had begun to implement a “containment‑and‑pressure” strategy, employing a combination of surveillance, psychological operations, and the threat of a “controlled breach” if the men refused to surrender. The threat was communicated through a loudspeaker, with the negotiators stating that the police would not hesitate to use force to protect the hostages if the men continued to threaten their lives.

On the fifth day, a breakthrough came when one of the men—Wesley Dick—requested a single, unarmed firearm to be provided to him as a symbol of trust. The police, wary of any escalation, agreed to supply a blank‑fired pistol, which was placed in a sealed envelope and handed to Dick. This concession, while seemingly minor, was interpreted by the men as a sign that the police were willing to negotiate in good faith.
