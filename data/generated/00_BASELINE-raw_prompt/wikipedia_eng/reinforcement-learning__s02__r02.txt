Thanks to these two key components, RL can be used in large environments in the following situations. First, when the state and action spaces are too vast for tabular methods, deep neural networks can approximate value functions or policies, allowing the agent to generalize from a handful of experiences to unseen states. Second, when the environment is stochastic or partially observable, recurrent architectures or belief‑state estimators can maintain an internal representation that captures temporal dependencies, thereby improving decision quality. Third, in continuous control domains—such as robotic manipulation or autonomous vehicle steering—policy gradient methods can directly output continuous actions, sidestepping the need for discretization and enabling smoother trajectories.

To illustrate, consider a robotic arm tasked with assembling delicate components. The arm’s joint angles constitute a continuous state vector, while the permissible torques form a continuous action space. A deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) agent learns a deterministic mapping from states to torques, while a critic network evaluates the expected return of each action. Over many episodes, the agent refines its policy to reduce assembly errors, even when the visual input is noisy and the exact component positions are only partially observable.

In another scenario, a fleet of electric vehicles (EVs) must decide when to charge or discharge from the grid to minimize cost while satisfying user mobility demands. Here, the environment is partially observable because future traffic patterns and renewable generation forecasts are uncertain. A multi‑agent reinforcement learning framework can coordinate the vehicles’ actions, sharing a common reward that balances individual user satisfaction against global grid stability. By employing a recurrent neural network to encode the history of observed prices and demands, each agent can approximate the value of delaying a charge, thereby reducing peak‑time tariffs.

The exploration–exploitation dilemma remains central to effective learning. Classic ε‑greedy strategies inject random actions with probability ε, gradually decaying ε as the agent becomes more confident. More sophisticated methods, such as Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) or Thompson sampling, explicitly quantify uncertainty in value estimates and bias exploration toward high‑uncertainty actions. In large‑scale problems, where exhaustive exploration is infeasible, model‑based approaches can simulate hypothetical trajectories, allowing the agent to plan without real‑world interaction. For instance, a learned dynamics model can predict the outcome of a sequence of control inputs, enabling the agent to evaluate long‑term consequences before committing to an action.

Another critical component is reward shaping. Sparse or delayed rewards can hinder learning; by adding intermediate signals that reflect proximity to the goal or compliance with safety constraints, the agent receives more frequent feedback. However, care must be taken to avoid altering the optimal policy.
