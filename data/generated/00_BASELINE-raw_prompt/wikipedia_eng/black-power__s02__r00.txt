In the subsequent years, the Black Power movement evolved from a series of isolated insurgent actions into a more structured network of organizations that sought to institutionalize black self‑determination. By 1970, the National Black United Front (NBUF) had emerged as a coalition of smaller groups, including the Black Liberation Army, the Young Lords, and the Nation of Islam, each bringing distinct theological, ideological, and tactical perspectives to the shared goal of dismantling systemic racism. The NBUF’s charter articulated a dual strategy: “political empowerment through grassroots organization and armed self‑defense against state violence” (27). This duality reflected the tension that had long plagued the movement between the non‑violent ethos of the Civil Rights era and the militant posture adopted by many Black Power adherents.

The 1971 Minneapolis police raid on a Black Panther Party (BPP) community center, which resulted in the death of three activists, became a pivotal moment that galvanized public opinion. The incident was widely reported in the underground press, prompting the release of a documentary titled *“The Minneapolis Massacre”* that highlighted the disproportionate use of force against African‑American communities. The BPP’s response—organizing a city‑wide march that attracted over 10,000 participants—demonstrated the movement’s capacity to mobilize mass protest while simultaneously advocating for armed self‑defense. This dual approach was later analyzed by scholars such as Angela Davis, who noted that “the Panthers’ dual strategy was not a contradiction but a necessary adaptation to the realities of state repression” (28).

The 1972 “Black Power for Social Change” conference, held in Atlanta, brought together leaders from across the spectrum—Stokely Carmichael, Angela Davis, Huey P. Newton, and even some moderate civil‑rights figures who had previously been skeptical of the movement’s militancy. The conference produced a manifesto that emphasized the importance of economic empowerment, education, and community control. It also called for a “universal coalition of oppressed peoples” that would include Latino, Asian‑American, and Native American activists. This broadened coalition was instrumental in the formation of the Coalition of Free People (CFP) in 1973, which sought to coordinate anti‑war, anti‑police‑violence, and anti‑racism campaigns across the United States.

Despite these advances, the Black Power movement faced significant internal and external challenges. The FBI’s COINTELPRO program intensified, employing infiltration, surveillance, and psychological operations to sow discord among activists. In 1974, a covert operation resulted in the murder of several BPP members in Chicago, a tragedy that was later revealed in the *COINTELPRO Files* released in 1979.
