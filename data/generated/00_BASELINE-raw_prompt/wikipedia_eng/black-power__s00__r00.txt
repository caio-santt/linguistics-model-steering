The movement’s momentum accelerated during the summer of 1967, when the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense was founded in Oakland, California, by Huey P. Newton and Bobby Seale. Their ten-point program, which called for free breakfast for children, free health care, and an end to police brutality, quickly spread to dozens of chapters across the country. By 1969 the Panthers had established community programs—free clinics, school lunch programs, and literacy classes—that resonated with neighborhoods that had long been neglected by city services. Their militant posture, however, provoked a heavy-handed response from federal agencies. The FBI’s COINTELPRO operation, launched in 1971, sought to discredit and dismantle the organization through infiltration, propaganda, and legal harassment. Despite these attacks, the Panthers maintained a presence in urban centers, and their rhetoric influenced a generation of activists who sought to combine grassroots empowerment with direct action.

In the early 1970s, the philosophy of black power expanded beyond militant self-defense. The National Black United Front, co-founded by Stokely Carmichael (later known as Kwame Ture), sought to unify various black liberation movements under a common strategy of political organization and community development. Carmichael’s “Black Power” speech at the 1968 Democratic National Convention, delivered in a confrontational yet articulate style, crystallized the movement’s demand for political representation and economic control. The rhetoric shifted toward a broader vision: the establishment of black-owned businesses, cooperative housing, and media outlets that could articulate the community’s perspectives without mediation by white institutions. This period also witnessed the emergence of black feminist voices, such as bell hooks and Audre Lorde, who critiqued the movement’s patriarchal tendencies and expanded the dialogue to encompass intersectionality.

The late 1970s and 1980s saw a decline in the visibility of black power as a unified movement, largely due to internal schisms, state repression, and the rise of neoliberal economic policies that marginalized black communities. Nonetheless, the legacy persisted in the form of community-based organizations, such as the National Urban League’s Black Empowerment Initiative, and in the continued activism of groups like the NAACP and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, which began to incorporate elements of self-determination and cultural pride into their strategies. The 1989 “Black Power” rally in Washington, D.C., organized by the United Front for Black Empowerment, demonstrated that the slogan still carried political weight, rallying thousands to demand reparations for slavery and systemic discrimination.

In the 1990s, the concept of black power was reinterpreted through the lens of global solidarity.
