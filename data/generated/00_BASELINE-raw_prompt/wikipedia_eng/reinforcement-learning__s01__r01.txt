[ 6 ] Exploration versus exploitation remains a central theme in reinforcement learning research.  The agent must balance the desire to gather information about the environment (exploration) with the need to act upon the best known policy (exploitation).  Classic strategies such as ε‑greedy, where the agent selects a random action with probability ε and follows the greedy policy otherwise, provide a simple yet effective mechanism to maintain this balance.  More sophisticated approaches, like Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithms or Thompson Sampling, offer principled ways to quantify uncertainty about action values and to guide exploration in a statistically sound manner [ 7 ].

[ 7 ] In many practical settings, the state and action spaces are too large for tabular representations of value functions.  Function approximation, often realized through linear models or neural networks, allows the agent to generalize across similar states.  The integration of deep neural networks with reinforcement learning—commonly referred to as deep reinforcement learning (DRL)—has led to remarkable achievements, from mastering Atari games to controlling complex robotic systems [ 8 ].  However, the combination of non‑stationary training data, high variance gradients, and the non‑convex nature of deep networks introduces instability and sample inefficiency, motivating research into more robust training protocols, such as experience replay and target networks.

[ 8 ] Policy‑based methods, which directly parameterize the action selection distribution, provide an alternative to value‑based approaches.  By optimizing a surrogate objective—often the expected cumulative reward—policy gradients can handle continuous action spaces and stochastic policies.  Variants like REINFORCE, Actor‑Critic, and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) have been shown to strike a balance between bias and variance, yielding stable learning dynamics in high‑dimensional environments [ 9 ].

[ 9 ] The theoretical foundations of reinforcement learning also encompass convergence guarantees and sample complexity bounds.  Under certain assumptions—such as finite state and action spaces, bounded rewards, and the use of tabular Q‑learning—convergence to the optimal Q‑function is guaranteed almost surely [ 10 ].  When function approximation is introduced, convergence is no longer guaranteed, and researchers have explored conditions under which approximate dynamic programming algorithms converge, including linear function approximation with compatible features and the use of stochastic approximation theory.

[ 10 ] Multi‑agent reinforcement learning (MARL) extends the single‑agent paradigm to scenarios where multiple learning entities interact within a shared environment.  The presence of other agents introduces non‑stationarity from the perspective of any individual agent, complicating both exploration and convergence.
