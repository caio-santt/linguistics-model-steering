The movement’s momentum surged further in the late 1960s, as the rhetoric of “Black Power” began to permeate popular consciousness and find resonance beyond the halls of academia. By 1967, the nascent Black Panther Party for Self‑Defense, founded in Oakland, California, by Huey P. Newton and Bobby Seale, had adopted the slogan as a rallying cry for militant self‑protection and community empowerment. Their armed patrols, the “community patrols,” were designed to counter police brutality, a tactic that earned both national attention and a polarized response from law‑enforcement agencies. The FBI’s COINTELPRO program, which had been active since the 1950s, intensified surveillance and infiltration of the Panthers, culminating in the infamous 1969 raid on the Oakland headquarters that led to the death of activist Fred Hampton in Chicago. 

In the same period, the Black Arts Movement (BAM) emerged as a cultural counterpart to the political activism. Artists, poets, and musicians such as Amiri Baraka, Gil Scott‑Moore, and Nina Simone harnessed the power of art to express Black pride and resistance. The movement’s manifesto, “The Black Arts Movement: The First 20 Years,” (1970) articulated a vision of cultural self‑definition that paralleled the political aims articulated by Carmichael and Hamilton. The synergy between the political and artistic spheres helped sustain the movement’s visibility and influence, even as the civil‑rights establishment grappled with the radical shift in rhetoric.

The late 1960s also saw a proliferation of Black nationalist organizations that adopted more separatist doctrines. The Nation of Islam, under the leadership of Elijah Muhammad and later Louis Farrakhan, continued to espouse a philosophy of Black self‑reliance, while the Black Liberation Army (BLA), an offshoot of the Panthers, pursued armed struggle against the state. These factions, though diverse in ideology, shared a common belief in the necessity of autonomous Black institutions. Their divergent strategies, however, caused schisms within the broader movement. For instance, the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, where protests erupted in response to the Vietnam War and racial injustice, highlighted tensions between the non‑violent civil‑rights leaders and the more radical activists. The televised images of police violence against demonstrators further galvanized the movement’s base, leading to a surge in membership and the establishment of community programs such as the Panther’s “Free Breakfast for Children” initiative.

The political implications of Black Power were felt across the United States. In 1969, the U.S. Senate’s Committee on Civil Rights, chaired by Senator Robert F. Kennedy, held hearings on the “Black Power” phenomenon, acknowledging its growing influence among the electorate.
