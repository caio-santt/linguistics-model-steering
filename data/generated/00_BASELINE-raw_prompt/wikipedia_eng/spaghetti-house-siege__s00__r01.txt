Following the gunman’s self‑inflicted wound, the police’s first priority was to stabilize the scene. Franklin Davies lay on the storeroom floor, blood pooling beneath the fluorescent lights, while the other two assailants—Wesley Dick and Anthony Munroe—were still alive but shaken. The fibre‑optic feed, which had been streaming the interior for the previous 144 hours, was immediately switched to a high‑resolution recording mode to capture the final moments of the standoff. The forensic psychiatrist, Dr. Margaret Ellis, who had been monitoring the psychological state of the trio, noted a marked shift in their demeanor: Davies’s voice had gone from defiant to desperate, and both Dick and Munroe exhibited signs of acute anxiety and hyper‑vigilance.

The police, guided by Ellis’s recommendations, opted for a “soft‑landing” approach. Officers in riot gear entered the storeroom through the back door, a route that had been identified during the surveillance as the least likely to trigger a violent response. They called out in a calm, measured tone, offering the remaining gunmen a chance to surrender without further bloodshed. Within minutes, Dick and Munroe lowered their weapons, the two of them clutching each other in a frantic, almost hysterical embrace. The officers secured them and escorted them out of the building, where they were immediately taken into custody.

The police press conference that followed was brief but heavily scripted. Commissioner James Whitaker, who had been at the scene since the early morning hours of the 28th, framed the incident as a “criminal act” rather than a political statement. “The officers on the ground made a difficult decision to protect the lives of the staff and customers of the Spaghetti House,” Whitaker said. “This was an act of robbery, not a protest.” He also hinted at the existence of a larger investigation into the alleged links between the gunmen and black liberation organisations, but he stopped short of naming any group.

The legal process that ensued was swift and uncompromising. Davies, who had already been declared a danger to public safety, was charged with attempted robbery, possession of a firearm without a licence, and assault with intent to kill. Dick and Munroe faced similar charges, with additional counts of conspiracy and unlawful possession of a weapon. The Crown’s case was bolstered by the forensic psychiatric report, which described the trio as “highly suspicious, ideologically motivated, and mentally unstable.” The judge, Lord Henry Marlow, sentenced Davies to life imprisonment, with a minimum term of 25 years, citing the self‑inflicted wound as a mitigating factor. Dick and Munroe received 18‑year sentences each, with the judge noting that their cooperation with the police had slightly reduced their culpability.
