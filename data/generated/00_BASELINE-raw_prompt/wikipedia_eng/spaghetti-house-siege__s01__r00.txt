The Italian consul’s involvement was brief; after the exchange was refused, he withdrew and the police tightened the perimeter. By the third day, the siege had attracted national media attention, and the police announced that they were prepared to use force if necessary. A tactical unit was assembled, and a small squad was dispatched to the building in a covert operation, but the officers were repelled by gunfire and the barricade was reinforced. [31] The men had already started to use the hostages as bargaining chips, demanding that their demands be met or else they would kill them. [32] 

On the fourth day, a second hostage, a 45‑year‑old clerk, was released after a negotiation that involved a promise of medical supplies for the wounded. The clerk was escorted out by a senior constable, who later admitted that the officers had to act quickly to prevent the hostage from becoming a casualty. [33] The police also began to gather intelligence on the men’s possible connections to other extremist groups, but no new information emerged. [34] Meanwhile, the men’s leader, Davies, sent a written statement to the press in which he claimed that the siege was a protest against systemic racism and that the police had misrepresented the event. [35] The statement was widely circulated, but the police maintained that the men were simply armed robbers. [36]

In the evening of the fifth day, the men took a third hostage—a 32‑year‑old accountant—and threatened to fire if their demands were not met. The police, in response, set up a listening post and recorded every word. [37] The recordings later proved useful in identifying the men’s communication patterns. The police also requested that the Home Secretary send a senior aide to the scene, but the request was denied. [38] The siege continued for another 12 hours, during which the men exchanged insults with the officers, and the police issued a stern warning that any further violence would result in lethal force. [39]

On the sixth day, a critical development occurred. A small group of the men, led by Wesley Dick, voluntarily stepped forward and offered to surrender in exchange for safe passage out of the country. The police accepted the offer, but the men were still armed and demanded that the police provide a safe escort. [40] A negotiation team, led by a senior negotiator from the Metropolitan Police, met with the men at a neutral location. The negotiations lasted for three hours, and the men finally agreed to surrender under the condition that they would not be prosecuted for the robbery. [41] The police, however, refused to make any concessions and insisted on arresting all participants.
