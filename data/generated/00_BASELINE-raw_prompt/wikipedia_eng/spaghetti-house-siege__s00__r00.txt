Sivanandan’s analysis, though brief in the report, underscored a broader pattern: the black liberation movements had become increasingly radicalised, and their rhetoric was often dismissed by authorities as mere criminality. In the days that followed the siege, the Metropolitan Police conducted a detailed debrief of the officers who had been on the scene, noting that the use of fibre‑optic cameras had provided a level of situational awareness that was unprecedented at the time. The forensic psychiatrist, Dr. Elaine Hartley, had been present throughout, and her reports were later cited in court as evidence of the mental state of the suspects.

The police’s approach to negotiations was cautious. They had been instructed to maintain a calm, non‑confrontational posture, and to avoid any action that could be construed as a provocation. When the hostages were released on 3 October, the officers were careful to document every exchange. The release itself was staged as a humanitarian gesture, and the police made no attempt to interrogate the gunmen on the spot, allowing them to surrender at a later time. The ringleader, Franklin Davies, was found with a self‑inflicted wound to the stomach. He was rushed to St. Bartholomew’s Hospital, where surgeons attempted to stabilise him, but he died the following day.

The subsequent legal proceedings were swift. Davies, Dick, and Munroe were charged with armed robbery, possession of firearms, and the assault of a police officer. The Crown Prosecution Service argued that the defendants had acted with no political motive, citing the lack of any political statement during the siege. In the courtroom, the prosecution highlighted the fact that the robbers had been armed and had taken hostages, thereby emphasizing the criminal nature of their actions. The defence, however, drew heavily on the statements made by the defendants during the siege, as well as the testimony of Dr. Hartley, who had observed signs of acute stress and a possible sense of persecution among the men.

The jury was instructed to consider the possibility that the defendants had been acting under a sense of political oppression. The judge, however, reminded the jury that the law did not recognise a “political justification” for armed robbery. The trial ended with convictions on all counts. Davies received a life sentence, while Dick and Munroe were given 20‑year terms, with the possibility of parole after 10 years. The judge noted that the sentences would be reviewed in light of the defendants’ conduct during the siege, including their eventual surrender and the release of the hostages.

In the weeks that followed, the case attracted widespread media attention. Newspapers ran stories that framed the siege as a “political hostage crisis,” while others portrayed it as a “criminal act of desperation.” The public debate was sharply divided.
