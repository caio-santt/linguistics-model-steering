The Italian consul’s intervention, however, did not alter the trajectory of the standoff. By the third day, the besieged men had begun to exhibit signs of fatigue; the cramped quarters and lack of adequate food had taken a toll on their physical stamina. A brief exchange of letters, penned in a mixture of English and French, was sent to the Metropolitan Police, in which the captors demanded an immediate cease‑fire in exchange for a guaranteed safe passage for the remaining hostages. The police, still wary of any political framing, declined to comply, insisting that any concession would only embolden further acts of violence. 

On the fourth day, a sudden escalation occurred. One of the hostages, a young clerk named Peter Davies, was found unconscious in the back room. He was immediately taken to the hospital, where doctors reported a severe case of hypothermia and dehydration. The incident prompted a surge of public pressure on the police to negotiate. Media outlets, previously silent, began to cover the siege in earnest, with live feeds from the front lines and commentary from political analysts. 

In the midst of this, a clandestine conversation between two senior officers—Inspector Alan Wright and Sergeant Emily Harper—unfolded in a back room of the police headquarters. They debated the merits of a tactical assault versus a prolonged negotiation. Wright, a veteran of several high‑profile operations, argued that a swift, decisive raid could end the siege before the captors’ resolve weakened. Harper, meanwhile, cautioned that an assault risked the lives of the hostages and could inflame public sentiment. The decision was eventually made to maintain the status quo, with the police reinforcing the perimeter and continuing to monitor the situation via radio.

The fifth day saw a brief lull. The captors, weary and hungry, sent a handwritten note to the police, demanding a modest amount of fresh fruit and a small quantity of water. The police, unwilling to give in to any demands, complied only with the request for water, citing health concerns. The fruit request was denied, which led to a short flare‑up of shouting within the hostage chamber. The police, however, remained calm, maintaining a firm stance that any further concessions would be futile.

On the sixth day, the police initiated a covert operation to infiltrate the building with a small team of negotiators. These negotiators, trained in crisis communication, attempted to establish a rapport with the captors. Their approach was to appeal to the captors’ sense of humanity, reminding them of the lives at stake. The captors, however, were unresponsive, citing distrust of law enforcement and a desire to keep their demands unaltered.
