The siege itself unfolded under a tense, almost theatrical atmosphere. The police cordoned the Spaghetti House with a perimeter of 200 officers and 15 armed officers in close‑quarters units. A network of fibre‑optic cameras was installed on the building’s façade and inside the storeroom, transmitting live footage to a command centre in the basement of the Metropolitan Police headquarters. The cameras were equipped with infrared lenses, allowing the police to see the gunmen’s movements even through the dimly lit storage rooms. The feed was monitored by a forensic psychiatrist, Dr. Margaret Hargreaves, who had been recruited specifically for this operation. Her role was to interpret the psychological state of the men and to advise the negotiators on the best approach to coax them into surrender.

Negotiations began at 08:00 on the first day. The gunmen, armed with a single 9mm pistol each, had taken the staff and a handful of diners as hostages. They were instructed by their own hand‑written notes to “protect the people of the world.” The notes were written in a mixture of English and Yoruba, with phrases such as “We are the future of Africa.” Dr. Hargreaves noted that the notes displayed a clear sense of ideological conviction, but also an underlying desperation. She reported that the men appeared to be in a state of heightened arousal, possibly due to the stress of being trapped and the lack of external contact.

The police adopted a “wait‑and‑watch” strategy. They did not attempt a direct assault, fearing that any sudden move could trigger a violent response. Instead, they focused on maintaining a constant presence, providing the men with basic necessities such as water and a single meal per day. The negotiators, led by Detective Inspector James McLeod, used a combination of empathy and firm communication. They repeatedly asked the gunmen to consider the lives of the hostages, reminding them that the police were ready to negotiate any time the men would step forward.

On the fifth day, a breakthrough occurred. A brief exchange of words between Davies and the negotiators revealed that the gunmen were willing to surrender if they could leave the country. The police, however, were unwilling to allow any of the men to escape. They offered the men a chance to stand trial, but only if they surrendered peacefully. After a prolonged back‑and‑forth, the men agreed to step out of the storeroom, each holding a single bullet. They were immediately taken into custody, with Davies being the first to surrender.

The aftermath of the siege was a mixture of relief and controversy. The police were praised for their restraint and for avoiding bloodshed, but critics argued that the operation had been a failure to secure a political resolution.
