The sentencing, delivered in a curt tone by the same judge, read: “Davies, Dick, and Munroe, you are hereby condemned to twenty‑two years’ imprisonment, with no possibility of parole.” The sentence was pronounced on the evening of 30 June, and the courtroom fell into a hushed silence as the gavel struck the wood. The three men sat in the back of the gallery, their faces a mixture of resignation and defiance, while the hostages, still shaken from the ordeal, watched from a distance, their eyes reflecting a quiet gratitude that had turned to something more complex – a sense of relief, tempered by the lingering shadows of the night’s violence.

Within the days that followed, the prison authorities began the process of transferring the convicts to HMP Brixton. The transport was conducted under heavy guard, with armed officers and a squad of K‑9 units accompanying the convoy. Davies, in particular, was placed in a solitary cell, a measure that the prison administration justified as necessary for his safety, given the threats he had reportedly received from rival gangs. The other two men were housed in a shared cell, where they were instructed to maintain a low profile and avoid any contact with the other inmates that might jeopardize their security.

The hostages, meanwhile, returned to their lives, though the psychological impact of the siege lingered. Several of them sought counseling services offered by the police and the local health authority, while others turned to community groups for support. The city council, after reviewing the incident, announced a new policy aimed at improving the training of officers in hostage negotiation and crisis management. A report, drafted by the Metropolitan Police Service, highlighted the importance of communication and the need for better protocols when dealing with armed criminals who might be ideologically driven.

In the weeks that followed, a public inquiry was convened to examine the conduct of the police during the operation. The inquiry, chaired by a senior judge, reviewed the footage from the CCTV cameras that had captured the moments leading up to the siege. The footage revealed that the police had employed a “shock and awe” approach, which, while effective in forcing the robbers to surrender, had also contributed to the chaos inside the restaurant. The inquiry’s findings were published in early September, and the police service issued a statement acknowledging the shortcomings of the operation, while also commending the bravery of the hostages who had cooperated with the officers.

Davies, during his time in prison, continued to write. He kept a journal, which he later claimed was a “record of my thoughts and the state of my soul.”
