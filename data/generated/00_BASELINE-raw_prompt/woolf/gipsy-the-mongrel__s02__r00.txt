She had always been a creature of habits, and it was those habits that made her the perfect companion for the sort of men who were more comfortable with the weather than with the weight of their own thoughts. Tom, who had once been a clerk in a small solicitor’s office, found himself drawn to the way the dog’s ears would perk up at the slightest rustle in the garden, as if hearing the very heartbeat of the world. Lucy, on the other hand, saw in Hector a mirror of her own stubbornness—a refusal to be tamed by society’s expectations.

“Did you ever notice how he would sit, just a moment, and then stare at the horizon as if he could see beyond the village?” Mary asked, her voice soft with the memory of that long afternoon when the sun had been a molten coin in the sky. “He was a man of the open air, even in a house that felt more like a cage to most of us.”

Lucy nodded. “And yet, he never let that cage define him. He’d dart out at the first sign of a wind, and then return with a grin that made us all forget the stiffness of our own collars.” Tom chuckled, a sound that was almost a bark in its timbre. “It was the way he would nuzzle my cheek, as if saying, ‘You are not alone in this world, Mr. Bagot.’”

The conversation drifted to the day Hector first arrived, a day that seemed to have been carved out of a different time. The dog’s arrival was announced by a knock at the door, a knock that was met with a mixture of excitement and apprehension. The man who had given them Hector—Hopkins, as Tom had always called him—had come in a coat that had seen better days, his boots scuffed with the grit of the countryside.

“We thought he’d be a simple thing, a pet,” Tom recalled, his eyes distant. “But Hector had a spirit that was as vast as the moorlands. He was a red setter, and the tail—well, the tail was a ramrod of a tail, as my brother would say, a sign of the blood he carried.” Lucy’s laugh was a short bark, echoing in the quiet of the room. “It was a gift, not a curse. He brought with him a piece of the world we could not see.”

Mary leaned forward, her fingers tapping the table.
