The letter arrived on a damp Tuesday, the sort of day that made the Thames feel like a silver snake in the fog. He read it with the same caution he had used to read the butcher’s receipts, half expecting the words to be a new set of demands from the neighbourhood council. Instead, the ink was neat, the handwriting unmistakably that of the old man who had once sold him a terrier for a night’s worth of rats.

“Dear Tom,” it began, “I write to you with a heart as heavy as the stones of the old bridge. There is a creature that has taken my name, my house, and my patience. He is a dog, a mongrel, a terror of the alley, yet he has the eyes of a man who knows the weight of a burden. He has come to stay with me, and I have no choice but to ask for your help.”

The narrator paused, the words hanging in the air like a loose thread. He had known the old man, Holland, for years, a man whose beard was as long as his memories. He had watched him grow old, his hands shaking when he spoke of the terrier that had once chased the cat, the cat that had been the wife’s favourite. The old man had always said that the dog was “a dog of character - a dog of remarkable character,” and the narrator had laughed, but never laughed hard enough to be honest.

The letter went on to describe the terrier’s first night in the house, how he had knocked over the pot of tea and how the cat had fled in a puff of smoke. The old man had taken the dog in, thinking perhaps the dog would be a good companion to his lonely wife. He had thought the dog would be a good companion, but the dog had turned the house into a battlefield. The dog had gnawed the curtains, scratched the floorboards, and, most importantly, had stolen the cat’s favourite feathered toy, which had been a talisman for the wife. The old man had, in his grief, decided that the dog had to be dealt with, and the letter ended with a plea: “Please, Tom, bring me a solution. I cannot bear the thought of losing my wife’s peace.”

The narrator felt a sudden chill. He had thought the dog was a mere animal, a creature that could be trained. He had thought the dog was a creature that could be beaten. He had thought the dog was a creature that could be killed. He had never thought the dog could be saved.
