looking at her as she had looked at the map of the woodland, a sudden thought darted through Ernest’s mind. “There is a place, Rosalind, where the deer do not fear the fox,” he murmured, his voice low, as though whispering to the very trees. “It is called the Hollow of Hoots, and the old owls guard it. If we can find it, perhaps we can learn why King Lappin’s nose twitches when the wind shifts.”

Rosalind’s eyes brightened, and she clapped her hands with delight. “A quest! Oh, Ernest, let us not delay. The rain has ceased, and the sun peeks through the clouds like a shy child. The day is perfect for a wander.”

They set off, the pair moving with the ease of old companions. Ernest, ever the civil servant, kept his notebook close, jotting down observations. Rosalind, meanwhile, hummed a tune that seemed to have been woven from the breezes themselves. The forest welcomed them with a chorus of birds, and the scent of pine and damp earth filled the air.

As they approached the Hollow, a low, resonant hoot echoed from the shadows. An owl, its plumage mottled like the bark of an ancient oak, perched upon a branch. “Hail, seekers,” it intoned, its voice as deep as the night. “Why do you tread the path of the Lappin?”

Ernest bowed his head. “We seek knowledge, wise one. We wish to understand the spirit of King Lappin, the noble rabbit of Porchester Terrace.”

The owl’s eyes glinted. “Then you must prove your worth. Follow the trail of silver leaves. When you reach the stone marked with a paw, you shall be granted the answer.”

The trail was indeed marked by silver leaves, shimmering with dew. They walked until a stone emerged from the moss, etched with a single paw print. Ernest touched it, and a gentle warmth spread through his fingers. He felt a sudden understanding, a whisper of the wind’s song. He turned to Rosalind and smiled.

“Do you feel it?” he asked, his voice trembling with awe. “The wind remembers the rabbit’s twitch, the way the leaves rustle in his wake. He is not merely a rabbit; he is a keeper of the forest’s breath.”

Rosalind nodded, her heart swelling with affection for the creature they had named King Lappin.
