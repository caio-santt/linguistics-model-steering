The next morning the train rattled through the hills, and Bagot found himself staring out the window at a landscape that had never seemed so familiar. He could not shake the feeling that the terrier’s eyes were following him, a silent witness to his own indecision. The dog, which he had named Gipsy after the old Irish cook’s nickname, lay curled beside him, breathing a slow, even rhythm that seemed to calm the storm inside his chest.

He remembered the letter, the one that had arrived with the butcher’s delivery, as if it were a second life. The ink had been smudged, the words cramped, but the message was clear: “She is a dog of character, a dog of remarkable character.” It had been a strange sort of endorsement, one that had made him feel less alone in his peculiar affection. The letter had come from a man named Holland, a fellow of some standing, and had been written in a tone that was both formal and oddly affectionate. It was as if Holland had seen something in Gipsy that Bagot had not yet been able to name.

Bagot turned to the old Biddy, who had been watching him from the kitchen doorway, her eyes narrowed in that skeptical way she always did when she suspected a plot. “You think this dog will keep the hens?” she asked, her voice low, almost a hiss. “You think she’ll protect the sheep?”

He shook his head, the gesture so small it might have gone unnoticed. “No,” he said, “I think she will keep me company. She’s a companion, Biddy. And if she can keep the hens, that’s a bonus.”

Biddy’s gaze flicked to Gipsy, who had now stretched out, his ears twitching at the sound of the train’s whistle. “A companion,” she repeated, her voice a mixture of amusement and disbelief. “A companion. Well, if that’s what you need, then I suppose she’s fine. But don’t expect her to do any of the hard work, Tom.”

Bagot smiled, a small, rueful smile that seemed to be a private joke between him and the dog. “I’ve never been the best at the hard work,” he admitted. “But I can be good at keeping company.”

The train clattered over the bridge, and the world outside blurred into a watercolor of greens and browns. Bagot’s thoughts drifted to the letter again.
