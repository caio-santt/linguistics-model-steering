The wind that slipped through the narrow window of that cramped London drawing‑room seemed to carry with it the faint, almost imperceptible scent of peat and heather, a scent that Mrs. Vallance could almost taste as though it had been poured into her very lungs. She turned her gaze to the heavy curtains, the thick drapes that blocked the light, and imagined the sun setting over the mist‑clad hills of the Highlands, bathing the distant glens in a golden glow that no London street lamp could ever hope to emulate. Her heart, a small, restless bird, beat with the rhythm of a far‑away drum, and she could not help but feel that the very walls of the room were breathing in a language she no longer understood.
