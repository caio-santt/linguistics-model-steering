and his sense there on the sunny stretch of grass at Kew of mastery, even as the distant hum of the city seeped through the hedges, a soft, insistent murmur that reminded him of the constant tick of his own heart, as though the world itself were a metronome. He paused, letting the scent of magnolia blossom mingle with the damp earth, a perfume that seemed to hold the very breath of the place, a perfume that whispered of forgotten secrets and future promises. In that quiet, the wolves of his mind, those relentless predators of doubt, seemed to grow silent, their snarls muffled by the rustle of leaves and the distant laughter of children playing in the conservatory gardens.

He turned his gaze to the lake, its surface a mirror, reflecting the pale blue of the sky and the silver of the reeds that floated like delicate, trembling insects. The lake was a stage, and he, a lone actor, rehearsing lines that had never been spoken aloud. He wondered, as if the very water were listening, whether the ripples would carry his thoughts to the far reaches of the world, or whether they would dissolve into the quiet hush of the evening.

The machine—his machine—was a strange contraption, a relic of a bygone era, its gears turning with a rhythm that echoed the pulse of his own life. He had brought it to Kew not for the sake of the garden, but for the sake of the silence it produced when it worked. The machine hummed, a low, steady thrum that seemed to pulse in synchrony with the beating of his own heart, a reminder that even in the midst of mechanical precision there was a space for human emotion.

Mrs. Sutton had come again, her presence a constant, like the tide that ebbed and flowed upon the shore. She had a way of speaking that was both gentle and sharp, a paradox that made her words feel like both balm and blade. She had said, in her own way, that nothing mattered to him, that nothing changed him. Her words were a paradox, a question that hovered over him like a cloud of smoke, a question that seemed to ask whether he would ever truly understand himself, or whether he would remain a stranger to his own soul.

He remembered the way she had held him in the past, her hands on his shoulders, her voice a lullaby that soothed the nerves that had been frayed by the weight of the world.
