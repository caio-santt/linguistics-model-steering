sitting up in bed in the quiet of the night, her mind drifting like a moth to the flicker of lamplight that once illuminated the corridors of her childhood home. She imagined the faint scent of lavender that her mother had once mixed with the cleaner’s bleach, a paradox of sweet and harsh that lingered in the memory of her own hands. In that imagined kitchen, the window was open, the night air carrying the distant hum of a city that never slept, and the stars, those old familiar companions, were bright enough to guide her through the maze of thoughts.

The thought of the garden, that old starlit garden, was a compass that had never failed her. She could hear the soft rustle of leaves, the way the wind bent the branches, and the echo of footsteps that had once been her father’s. He had always believed that the world was a book and that the pages were written in the language of nature. He would have said that the scent of wet earth was a poem, and she had always tried to listen to it. She remembered his hands, rough and calloused, yet gentle when he brushed a petal against her cheek, and the way he’d whisper that every flower was a story, a secret waiting to be discovered.

Her own story, she thought, was a thread woven into the tapestry of that garden. The thread was fragile, but it was strong enough to hold her, even when the world seemed to be an endless maze of brick and glass. She pictured the small wooden box that her mother had given her, a box that held dried roses and a note that read: “Hold onto the beauty, even when the world is a storm.” The storm, she realized, was London, with its endless traffic and its relentless chatter, a place where people moved like machines, their faces unreadable.

She closed her eyes and let the memory settle, the rhythm of her breathing becoming a metronome for her thoughts. The ticking of the old clock on the mantelpiece was a steady reminder of time’s passage. The ticking was a drumbeat, and she felt her heart echo in sync with it. She could almost feel the presence of the old Mr. Rogers, with his spectacles perched on the tip of his nose, telling stories about the stars and how they were like tiny lanterns, each with its own secret.

Her thoughts turned to the present, to the people in the drawing-room, to the laughter that seemed so far away.
