She found herself, in that moment, standing at the threshold of a hall that seemed to have been borrowed from a dream and a nursery rhyme, the walls lined with portraits of ancestors who had all, it seemed, been rabbits in disguise. The great drawing‑room was a cathedral of satin, the wallpaper shimmering like a moonlit pond, the family portraits staring back with the solemnity of a long‑forgotten covenant. She felt, as if a single, bright star had been misplaced among a galaxy of dull ones, her own smallness magnified by the grandiosity of the Thorburn lineage.

The guests, all in their finest, moved about with the grace of trained dancers, but their eyes were always fixed upon the table where the Lord of the Manor had placed a platter of fresh rabbit legs, the scent of which mingled with the perfume of lavender and the faint echo of a distant forest. Rosalind’s heart beat faster, her mind racing through the absurdity of it all: a woman who had once known only the barren, moonlit stretches of her own domain now standing in a room where rabbits were not only the subjects of conversation but the center of a feast.

She glanced at King Lappin, who was perched on a velvet sofa, his ears twitching in anticipation of the next anecdote. He had a twinkle in his eye that betrayed his affection for her, and he seemed to relish the fact that he could now share his world with her in a way that no one else could. He was, after all, a king of rabbits, and she, a queen who had ruled over a desolate place that had only known the night. Their partnership had turned their private world into a secret garden where rabbits hopped about under the light of a silver moon, unseen by the prying eyes of the world.

The party began with a toast. Mrs. Reginald Thorburn, who had played the part of the Squire so perfectly in their little theatre, raised her glass. “To the union of the Thorburns,” she declared, “and to the endless bounty of our land!” The guests cheered, the clink of glasses ringing through the hall like a choir of silver bells. Rosalind felt a sudden surge of gratitude for the strange, unspoken bond that tied her to this family, for the way they had all, in their own peculiar way, accepted her as one of their own.

A few minutes later, a young man named Ernest, the sporting brother, approached them with a mischievous grin.
