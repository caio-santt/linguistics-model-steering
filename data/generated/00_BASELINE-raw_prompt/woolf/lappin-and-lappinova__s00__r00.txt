The breakfast was a modest affair, served on a chipped porcelain plate that had once belonged to a grandmother who had lived in the same building in 1923. The smell of freshly brewed tea mingled with the faint scent of pine from the lake, and the table was set with a single, bright blue napkin that looked oddly out of place on the worn oak table. Ernest shuffled in, his coat still damp from the morning mist, and he dropped his briefcase with a clatter that startled the pigeons perched on the windowsill.

"Morning, love," he said, his voice low and slightly husky, as if he had just emerged from a long, quiet dream. He slid into the chair opposite her, his eyes flicking over her face with a tenderness that made her heart skip a beat. He reached for the tea, but his hand brushed against the edge of the plate, and a tiny, almost imperceptible twitch appeared in his nose. Rosalind's eyes widened, and she let out a soft laugh that surprised even herself.

"You know," she murmured, "I never realized how much you look like a rabbit when you concentrate." Her words hung in the air, half playful, half sincere. Ernest's lips curved into a smile that seemed to stretch from ear to ear. "Well, I suppose I am a rabbit in disguise," he replied, and the twitch in his nose seemed to grow a little more pronounced, as if he were trying to make the joke work.

The Swiss waiter, who had been quietly refilling the sugar dish, turned his head toward them, a polite smile on his face. He had been watching them from the corner of the room, and he could not help but think that the couple was a strange but endearing pair. He had heard of many such oddities in London, but this one was a new addition to the city’s tapestry of stories.

Rosalind's mind drifted back to the wedding day, to the image of the fox terrier sauntering across the path, to the pigeons that fluttered like tiny, winged confetti. She had laughed then, too, and the memory made her smile. The wedding had been a blur of rice, blue eyes, and a car that smelled of new leather and old stories.
