and each of them, with a conspiratorial glance, wondered whether the marriage would turn out to be a grand opera or a quiet lullaby. The silence that followed was not the silence of a wedding day but the soft hush that comes when a new chapter is about to begin, like the pause before a violinist draws his bow across a string.

Rosalind’s mind drifted to the small, neat apartment on the second floor of the hotel, where the bed was still dressed in crisp white sheets, and the window looked out onto the lake that shone like a polished glass bowl. The mountains beyond the water seemed to lean in, as if listening to her thoughts. She imagined herself as a young bride in a different era, perhaps in a country house with a garden that smelled of lavender and fresh-cut grass. Yet here she was, the wife of a man who had, in a way, taken her by surprise. He had never asked her for a name that sounded like a poem or a rhyme. He had simply been Ernest, a name that was neither too grand nor too simple, a name that fit the quiet rhythm of their life together.

The hotel staff, who had become accustomed to her presence, carried out their duties with a polite efficiency that left her feeling both at ease and slightly overwhelmed. The Swiss waiter, whose greasy black jacket had become a sort of trademark, presented the breakfast table with a flourish. A tray of croissants, a pot of freshly brewed coffee, and a platter of smoked salmon were laid before her. Ernest, who had been busy making a cup of tea, appeared at the window with a smile that seemed to say, “All is well.” He had brought with him a small, crinkled envelope, which he slid across the table to her. Inside was a photograph of the lake from the day of their wedding, the sun glinting off the water, the pigeons still fluttering in the background, and a caption that read, “For the moments when you forget who you are and remember who you have become.”

She opened the envelope, and the picture seemed to come alive, as if the pigeons were still there, flapping their wings in a slow, rhythmic dance. She looked at Ernest, and he looked back, his eyes reflecting the same quiet joy she felt. He reached for a croissant, and she reached for a piece of smoked salmon, and they ate in companionable silence, each of them savoring the moment and the taste of their new life together.
