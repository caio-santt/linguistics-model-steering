They all sat around the crackling fire in the drawing‑room, the night thick with the scent of cedar and old books. Lucy’s eyes were fixed on the little figure of Hector, who lay at the foot of the mantelpiece, his head tilted as if listening to something only he could hear. The others were silent, each lost in the memory of the dog’s first day in the house, when he had bounded through the front door with a bark that sounded more like a laugh than a warning.

Mary Bridger, who had been the quietest of the group, finally broke the hush. “You know, I never quite understood why people think a dog can judge a man,” she said, her voice soft as the wind outside. “But Hector… he seems to see right through us.”

Tom Bagot chuckled, a low, resonant sound that filled the room. “You’re a poet, Mary,” he said, “but I’ve seen him chase a hare through the garden and then, just a moment later, he sits beside a lady who has no more than a limp in her right foot. He knows kindness is not a question of breed or blood.”

Lucy smiled, her gaze flickering to the window where the moonlight painted silver on the old oak floor. “Hector was born into a world of hounds and hunting parties,” she began, “but he learned that a true companion is one who listens, not one who speaks. He never made a mistake, as you say. He would sniff the air, and if a stranger came in, he would either greet them with a wagging tail or lead them to the door, as if to say, ‘You’re welcome, but I’ve got a job to do.’”

Mary lifted a hand, as if to hold the memory in her palm. “And the man who gave us Hector,” she recalled, “the stockbroker named Hopkins? He was a proud man, but he did not know the value of a dog that could read a person’s heart. He thought Hector was a waste of money, a piece of fluff. Yet Hector turned that shame into a lesson for us all.”

The room seemed to lean in, the firelight dancing on their faces. Tom’s eyes softened as he spoke of the day Hector first met Lucy. “She was at the market, buying a basket of apples,” he remembered, “and Hector followed her, nose to the ground. He barked softly, a sound that seemed to say, ‘I am here for you.’
