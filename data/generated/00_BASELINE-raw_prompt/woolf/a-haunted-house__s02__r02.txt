The lantern trembled in his fingers, a single flame that dared to slice the gloom. The hallway stretched like a corridor of forgotten memories, each step echoing against the cold stone. Beyond the threshold, the air grew thicker, the scent of damp earth mingling with a faint perfume of old roses. He paused, feeling the weight of the silence pressing against his chest, and whispered, “Still, still, still.”

A soft sigh curled from the walls, as if the house itself exhaled. The glow of the lantern painted wavering silhouettes on the cracked plaster, dancing like restless spirits. He turned a corner, and the air shifted; a faint scent of cedar and mothballs rose, a ghostly perfume of a time when the house had been alive. The sound of his own breath seemed louder than any wind that might have been there.

In the dim light, a door stood ajar, its frame warped by years of neglect. He pushed it open with a hesitant hand. Inside, a room lay shrouded in darkness, its ceiling sagging like an old sigh. The only illumination came from the lantern, casting a pool of amber light that seemed to breathe. The floor was covered in a thick layer of dust, each mote catching the light like tiny stars.

The ghostly couple—his mind conjuring their silent forms—watched from the shadows. He could feel their presence, a gentle weight on his shoulders, as if they were waiting for him to uncover what lay hidden. The air grew colder, a chill that brushed his skin like a whisper. He exhaled slowly, letting the breath mingle with the dust in the room.

“Where is the treasure?” he asked, his voice barely a tremor. The silence answered him, a hollow echo that seemed to reverberate through the walls. The lantern’s flame flickered, and the shadows seemed to pulse in time with the heartbeat of the house.

He stepped forward, his feet sinking into the soft, damp floorboards. The sound of his movement was muffled, as if the house was absorbing the noise. He turned the corner of the room, and there it was—a chest, old and ornate, its surface carved with intricate vines that curled like ivy. The chest was tucked beneath a faded tapestry that had once draped the wall, the tapestry now a tattered relic of a forgotten era.

The chest’s lock was rusted, but the wood beneath it glowed faintly, as if a hidden light was pulsing within. He reached for the keyhole, his fingers trembling.
