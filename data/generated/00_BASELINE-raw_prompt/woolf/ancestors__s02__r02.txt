The room seemed to lean in, as if it too could hear the quiet echo of those long‑ago afternoons. She imagined the cedar tree's leaves rustling, the faint scent of pine mingling with the sweet perfume of the lilies that had once framed her childhood bedroom. The memory of that garden, of the pond that reflected the starlight, was not a picture but a living, breathing thing she could step into. She could almost feel the rough bark of the tree against her palm, the cool, damp earth beneath her bare feet, the soft murmur of the wind that had carried the scent of Mrs. Dalloway’s tea into her mind.

She thought of the old gardener, Andrewes, whose hands had always been stained with the dark green of the soil, of the way he had taught her to plant the roses with patience, that same patience she now felt slipping away like the last drops of rain from a windowpane. Jersy the cook, whose laughter had once filled the kitchen with a warmth that seemed to shield her from the chill of the outside world. The old servants, their faces etched with lines of years, yet their eyes still held the kindness that had made the house feel like a home, not a building. In that quiet reverie, she could almost hear the soft clink of silverware, the faint crackle of the fire, the gentle sigh of a well‑tended hearth.

And yet, in the midst of all this tenderness, there was a hollow that had never quite been filled. The memory of her father, the man in the white linen coat who had always smelled of tobacco and rain, was a phantom that hovered just beyond her reach. He had taught her the cadence of Shelley’s verse, had whispered the lines of the ‘Ode to the West Wind’ into her ear, as if the words could shield her from the storm. She remembered the way his hands had brushed her hair, the way his eyes had glimmered with pride, the way he had laughed at her recitations, his voice a steady drumbeat against the clamor of the world. That laughter, now, was a distant echo that seemed to drift away each time she tried to grasp it.

The tears that had begun to fall were not only for the loss of those who had died, but for the loss of a part of herself that had once been so vivid, so bright.
