The wind that slipped through the cracked shutters seemed to carry whispers of the past, a sigh that curled around the garden’s hedges, turning every leaf into a trembling note. The couple, still hand in hand, moved like a shadow across the floorboards, their footsteps a quiet percussion in the vast silence. Their eyes, dark pools reflecting the empty rooms, searched for a glint that was never there, a promise hidden beneath the dust of forgotten years.

She paused before the attic door, the hinges creaking like a sigh from the deep. “Do you feel it?” she asked, her voice a thread of wind. He nodded, his breath a mist that mingled with the cool air of the loft. The apples, now dry and brittle, lay scattered like amber coins in the rafters, each one a silent witness to the passing of time. They lifted the smallest, the one that had once glowed like a sunrise, and held it up against the faint light that seeped through the cracked window.

“Maybe it’s not in the house,” he whispered, “maybe it’s in the memory of the sun that once kissed these walls.” The apple’s skin cracked, revealing a pulse of golden light that flickered against the dark. It seemed to pulse in time with the house’s own heart, a rhythm that had never been heard before. The couple stood in awe, their eyes reflecting the flicker, as if the apple had become a lantern for their lost hopes.

They turned toward the garden, where the grass was still damp from a night of rain, and the earth smelled of earth and old secrets. The garden’s stone path, worn smooth by centuries of footsteps, led them to a forgotten well that had once fed the orchard. The well’s mouth was a black mirror, reflecting the night sky, the stars, and the faint glow of the apple in his hand. He dropped the apple into the well, and as it sank, the water swirled, and the sound of the house seemed to echo from within the depths.

The house’s pulse, once steady, now thudded like a drum in the distance, a reminder that something unseen was moving. The walls, once blank, now whispered with the voices of those who had walked before, each one a fragment of a story that had been swallowed by time. The couple listened, and they heard the faintest echo of laughter, the rustle of pages turning, and the sigh of a wind that had never been there.
