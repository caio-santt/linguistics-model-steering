The night thickened around the hearth, the fire throwing long, flickering shadows across the worn wooden panels, and the Bridgers and Bagots leaned in, as if the very walls might overhear their thoughts. Lucy’s voice, soft as the wind through the thatch, cut through the silence. “There was a moment, Mary, when Helen’s laugh rang out across the field like a bell, and the wind carried it to the sea.” Mary, who had always been the most reflective of the group, let the words hang, eyes distant, as though she could see Helen’s face in the flames.

Tom, who had been quiet until now, cleared his throat. “It was on the night of the harvest festival, the one when the moon was a silver coin, that she slipped away. No one saw her leave the path, only the wind whispered that she had followed the sound of the whistle.” The whistle, that ghostly note that had seemed to echo from the far fields, had become a symbol of something lost and found.

Old Holland, who had been listening with a furrowed brow, finally spoke. “I remember that night, the snow falling thick, and the dog—” he gestured to the empty space beside the fire where the dog’s silhouette had once rested. “It was the same dog that had followed Helen. He was a black terrier, all coat and eyes that glowed like embers. He’d been with her since she was a child, and he never left her side. The night she vanished, he was the last to see her, and then he vanished too.” The room seemed to grow colder, the fire’s warmth a mere memory.

Mary, her voice trembling, added, “They say that the dog was the keeper of secrets. In the old days, people believed that a dog’s bark could ward off evil spirits. Perhaps Helen had been taken by something that only a dog could sense.” Lucy nodded, her eyes reflecting the firelight. “Yes, and the whistle—was it a train, or a siren, or the voice of the wind? The sound that faded over the flat Suffolk fields, it was like a prayer carried on the night air.”

The conversation turned to the basket that had been found in the hedge, a rush basket with a scrap of a dog stitched inside, the very same dog that had once held Helen’s hand. “It was not a mere basket,” Tom said, “it was a message. In the old tongue, a basket with a dog inside means ‘guard the lost.’
