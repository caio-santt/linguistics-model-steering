In the hush of the attic, a whisper curled around the rafters, a memory that clung to the dust like a moth to a lantern. The beam of light, fractured by the cracks of the old window, painted a lattice across the wooden floorboards, and somewhere between the shadows and the silvered glow, the scent of apples lingered, faint as a sigh.

She lifted her hand, fingers trembling, as if touching the very breath of the house. The ghost of the couple, their laughter a faded echo, hovered near the corner where the rafters met the ceiling. Their eyes, though long past mortal sight, flickered with a quiet joy, as though they were still dancing in a sunlit garden. The air was thick with the perfume of roses that had once bloomed in the garden, their petals now long gone, yet their memory pressed into the walls.

The pulse of the house grew louder, a steady thrum that resonated with the beating heart of the earth. It was a rhythm that had guided generations through the seasons, through the harvests, through the quiet nights when the wind sang through the oaks. The house, in its silent wisdom, remembered the laughter of children running through the apple orchard, the clatter of the threshing machine, the soft footfalls of the old couple on the creaking floorboards.

The treasure, whispered in the pulse, was not a chest of gold, nor a trove of jewels. It was the memory of a life lived in the cradle of the earth, the love that had stitched itself into the very timber of the house. It was the song of the wood pigeon, the bubble of sound that carried the wind across the fields, the gentle rustle of leaves that had brushed against the windowsills. It was the quiet, unspoken promise that even in death, the house held the echoes of those who had loved it.

She pressed her palm to the stone of the old hearth, feeling the warmth that lingered from a fire long extinguished. The flames had once danced upon the walls, their shadows flickering across the portraits of ancestors, their faces turned toward the hearth as if seeking comfort. Now the hearth was cold, but the memory of its heat was still a living ember in her chest.

The garden outside was a tapestry of forgotten dreams. The apple trees, their branches heavy with fruit, stood silent, their apples now turned to dust, their scent lingering in the cool night air.
