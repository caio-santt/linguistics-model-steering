The hush settled deeper, the house breathing like a patient heart beneath the moon’s watch. “Safe, safe, safe,” the wind whispered through the cracked panes, a lullaby for the walls that had known centuries of silence. The lantern’s flame flickered, casting a wavering silhouette across the cracked floorboards, as if the very light were a trembling ghost itself.

I stepped forward, the worn wooden steps groaning beneath my weight. The air grew colder, a breath of wind that smelled of damp stone and old roses that had long since withered. In the hallway, the portraits of the long‑gone family stared down with eyes that seemed to follow my every move, their painted smiles turning into quiet, knowing nods. The pulse of the house, that steady, gentle thrum, seemed to echo through the marrow of my bones.

“Where does the treasure lie?” I asked the silence, the question more to the house than to any living soul. The walls answered in the rustle of moth wings and the faint scent of cedar. A distant creak resonated from the attic, as if the old rafters were sighing in agreement.

In the attic, the moonlight spilled like silver liquid, pooling in the corners where dust motes drifted in slow, lazy spirals. A single sheet lay open, its pages yellowed, ink faded, yet the words remained—an old diary of a woman who had once loved a man who had vanished with the dawn. Her trembling hand had written, “The treasure is not gold, but the memory of us.” The ink was almost invisible, but the message was clear as the moonlit night.

The ghostly couple, still bound to the house, lingered in the doorway. Their translucent forms swayed, the woman’s dress flowing like water, her hair a halo of silver. He, with a coat of faded charcoal, held his hand in mine, not in the way of the living but in the quiet, unspoken way of eternity. He lifted his gaze to the attic, and his eyes met mine, reflecting the same weary longing that had haunted him for centuries.

“Safe, safe, safe,” he murmured, the words carrying through the rafters, through the very bones of the house. The wind, a companion in this silent dialogue, carried the sound back to me, wrapping it in a cloak of comfort and sorrow.

I reached into the attic, fingers brushing the worn leather of a small box.
