And so the day went on, with the terrier pacing the kitchen, ears perked as if listening for a distant train whistle, and Tom Bagot, who had never owned a dog before, feeling a strange sort of weight in his chest that was neither grief nor joy but something like an unspoken promise. He watched the animal, a creature of shaggy fur and bright eyes, as it bounded between the pots and the stove, as if the very act of moving was a prayer. It was the sort of animal that could sense the old man's moods, and he began to wonder whether it was the dog that made the house feel less lonely or whether the house had simply given the dog a place to call home.

The letter, which had arrived that very morning, lay on the table beside the flour bowl, its ink faded but its message still sharp as a knife. It was from a distant relative, a cousin who had left England for the New World, telling Tom that the terrier had been found abandoned on a farm in the Midlands, and that the cousin had arranged for the dog to be sent to him. The cousin, with his thick accent, had insisted that the dog was “the sort of creature that would keep a man from becoming a stranger to himself.” Tom, who had been a man of routine and habits, felt a sudden surge of gratitude that he could not quite explain.

He remembered the night the cat had been killed, how the whole house had seemed to shiver with the loss of that small, purring soul. The cat had been the wife’s favourite, and the death had left a hole that no one could fill. He had thought that perhaps the terrier would fill that hole, but the thought of a dog living with the cat’s memory was too much. Yet, as the dog began to settle into the corner of the kitchen, licking the floor with a rhythm that seemed almost musical, Tom felt the old ache soften. He could almost hear the cat’s purr in the background, a ghostly echo that mingled with the dog’s whine.

The next morning, the dog was still there, waiting at the door as if it had been there forever. Tom, who had been called upon by the neighbours to take the dog to the market for a vet check, found himself standing in the yard with the terrier’s leash in his hand. The neighbour, a woman with a kind face and a soft voice, whispered, “It’s a good dog, Tom. It will keep the hens safe, and the sheep will not be bothered.”
