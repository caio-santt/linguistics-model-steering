She lingered in that quiet corner of the drawing‑room, the faint scent of lavender from the roses on the sill mingling with the dry, old paper of the books that had once lined her parents’ shelves. The clock on the mantel ticked, a steady metronome that seemed to count the seconds of a life that had already passed through so many seasons. She could hear, faintly, the murmur of the guests in the main hall, the clink of glasses, the soft laugh of Mrs. Dalloway as she teased the young men about their latest romantic escapades. Yet her mind was far from the present; it had drifted back to that summer afternoon in the garden where the cedar trees swayed like dancers, their leaves whispering secrets to the wind.

In that memory she saw herself again, that little girl with a cotton frock, her hair caught in the breeze, eyes wide with wonder as she read the “Ode to the West Wind.” The poem had seemed to her then a spell, a promise that she could turn the world into something else, that she could bend the wind to her will. She remembered the way her father had smiled, his hands rough from a life of toil, yet his eyes softened whenever she spoke of her dreams. He had told her that the world was a book, and she had been the reader who could find the meaning hidden between the lines. She had taken his words to heart, and she had carried them with her into the attic, into the pine‑wood rooms that smelled of old books and fresh ink.

Now, standing in the drawing‑room, she felt the weight of those words settle upon her chest. The same ache that had once made her weep at the thought of her mother’s solitary vigil in the garden, the one woman who had tended the roses while the others danced, had returned. The garden had been a sanctuary, a place where the ordinary became extraordinary, where the scent of lilacs could lift the soul. It was there that she had learned to read the wind, to listen to the stories that the leaves told. And she had learned that the wind was not just a force of nature but a messenger, carrying the voices of those who had passed, of those who were still there.
