The Bridgers listened in quiet rapt attention as Tom unfolded the tale, his voice low and steady, the fire casting a warm glow across their faces. “It was a bitter cold in that year,” he began, “the wind howled like a pack of wolves and the snow fell in sheets. I had to make a trip to the market in the village of Larkfield to buy some bread and a few extra sacks for the cows. The road was slick, and the path was only a thin line of blackened stones, but I pushed on, determined not to let the frost catch me off guard.” He paused, looking out at the flickering flames as if they might offer him some solace. “And there, by the hedges, I saw her.” His eyes flicked to Lucy, who leaned forward, her curiosity piqued.

“The dog was a small greyhound, her coat a soft grey, almost like the clouds that had settled over the fields. She was a stray, I think, for she had no collar or tag. She ran straight to me, her tail wagging with a fierce, almost desperate joy, as if she knew that the world was a place of fleeting moments.” Tom’s voice softened, and his hands, though still rough from the day's work, moved to gesture the dog's swift movements. “I scooped her up, wrapped her in my coat, and carried her back to my cottage. The wind was so fierce that I could barely hear the sound of my own breath. The dog, she didn’t seem to mind the cold. She lay on my lap, her eyes bright, and she looked at me as if she were a child looking at a parent.” He chuckled softly, a sound that was almost a laugh. “I thought to myself, 'What a lucky dog, to find a man who would keep her warm in such a cold night.'”

A hush fell over the room, broken only by the crackling of the fire. Lucy whispered, “It’s like a story from a book, Tom. It feels almost… magical.”

Tom nodded. “I know, Lucy. It’s not just a story. It’s a memory, a piece of the world that we all share. It reminds us that even in the harshest of times, there is warmth to be found.”

The Bridgers shifted, and Mary spoke softly, her voice a gentle thread that wove through the room. “You know, Tom, it reminds me of Helen.
