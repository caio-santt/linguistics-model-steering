Why, he thought, did the river seem to mock him, its silver surface a mirror of the sky that had once been a clear blue but now wore a veil of clouds as if it, too, were pondering his solitary steps? The banks of the Thames, in that late summer hour, were littered with the fallen leaves of oaks that had stood for centuries, their branches, like old friends, swaying in a wind that carried the scent of distant fields and the faint, metallic taste of iron from a passing carriage. He paused, feeling the dampness of the grass under his bare feet, and for a moment the world seemed to hold its breath, as though the very air were waiting for him to speak.

Mrs. Sutton, who had followed him with the solemnity of a pilgrim, paused beside a willow that drooped its green tendrils over the water, and she, in her quiet, considered the man who had walked from the garden of Kew, a place that had once been a sanctuary of order and blossoms, now a memory that drifted like a phantom in his mind. She spoke, her voice a whisper of the wind, "Do you find, sir, that the river remembers the names of the stones that lie beneath it?" He turned to her, eyes reflecting the pale light that filtered through the clouds, and said, "The river remembers only what it has seen, and I, I have seen too much to remember names, only the shape of the world as it changes."

The wolf, that wild creature that had been both companion and warning, lay beside him on the bank, its fur damp from the river's mist. It stared at the man with a gaze that seemed to say, "You have walked many paths, but the path you choose is yours alone." He lifted his hand, and the wolf's ears flicked as if it were listening to a song only it could hear. The man smiled, a small, almost imperceptible thing, and he thought of the women with starched cyclamen-like frills, their faces pale as the moon, their lips set in a line that seemed to echo the solemnity of the river's own silence.

He remembered, in a sudden, almost jarring flash, the day he had walked from Kew to the river. He had left behind the magnolias and azaleas, the very flowers that had once whispered secrets of a world that was orderly and predictable. The river, however, had been a place of change, of constant motion, and he had felt, for a fleeting instant, that his heart had matched the rhythm of its current.
