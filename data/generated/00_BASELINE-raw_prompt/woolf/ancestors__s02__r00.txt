The wind that had once whispered through the cedar leaves seemed to have slowed, as if it, too, were remembering the hush that fell over that summer night when the garden was a cathedral of shadows and light. She closed her eyes and let the scent of pine and wet earth drift back to her, a perfume that had always been the threshold between the living and the remembered. In that quiet space, the past and present wove together like the threads of a tapestry she had never dared to unravel.

She could almost hear her father's voice, low and steady, as he spoke of the weather and the way the river sang its own song in the distance. He had always said that the wind was a messenger, carrying the secrets of the world, and she had taken that to mean that the wind carried her own story as well. In the stillness of the attic, the same wind that once lifted her hair and set her free now brushed against the pages of her childhood books, turning them as if to read aloud the verses she had once whispered to the stars.

The garden, with its tangled vines and the old stone pump that had stood since the time of her grandparents, seemed to have grown old with her. The flowers that had once bloomed in bright, reckless colors now grew in muted hues, but their fragrance was no less potent. She remembered the afternoons spent chasing the swallows that nested in the eaves, the way they would dart through the air as if they too were trying to catch a fleeting moment. And there was the old dog, Sultan, whose heavy paws had left a trail of soft mud on the path that led to the pond. He had always watched her from the threshold, a silent guardian of the memories that she carried like a fragile treasure.

She thought of the people who had left the garden's borders, of the ones whose names had faded into the mist of time. The old servants, Andrewes and Jersy, had left their marks on the soil, their hands having carved the paths that she now walked alone. The way they had laughed, the way they had carried the burdens of the house with a quiet dignity, it was as if their spirits had become part of the very stones that held the garden together. Mrs. Vallance, with her sharp eyes and sharp wit, had once scolded her for not tending the roses properly, yet she had also taught her that beauty could be found even in the most stubborn thorns.
