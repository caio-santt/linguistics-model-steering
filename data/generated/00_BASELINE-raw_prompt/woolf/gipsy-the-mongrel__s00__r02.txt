They'd given her a hunk of bread and a twist of straw, and the dog, a small thing with a heart that seemed larger than the world itself, had gnawed the crumbs with a patience that made the farmer sigh in relief. The night had grown colder, the fire in the hearth flickering like a dying star, and the quiet that settled over the Bridgers and Bagots was filled with a kind of reverence that only loss can bring.

Mary Bridger, her eyes still catching the dancing embers, leaned forward and said, “It was not just the dog that survived that night. It was the memory of the boy who had once stood by the riverbank and whispered to the wind, hoping the wind would carry his words to someone far away.” Her voice was a soft murmur, like the rustle of leaves in a distant storm. The others listened, the silence between them thick as the smoke that curled from the hearth.

Lucy Bagot, who had always been quick to find humour in the darkest of corners, nodded slowly. “We have all lost something, haven’t we?” she murmured. “And yet we remember the smiles that once lit our faces.” The phrase hung in the air, heavy and tender. The same words that had floated from the lips of a girl who had vanished, a girl whose smile was a light that no one could ever truly dim.

The old train whistle, a ghostly echo that had drifted across the flat Suffolk fields, seemed to seep into the room, a reminder that time itself was a relentless traveler. The Bridgers, with their stoic faces, seemed to recall a different train, one that had carried a young woman into the night, and had never returned her to the warmth of the fire. Their eyes flickered, and Tom Bagot, who had been the most reserved of the group, let out a breath that sounded like a sigh.

“Perhaps she left with the whistle,” he said softly, his voice barely above the crackle of the fire. “Perhaps she chose the silence over the noise.” He looked at Lucy, at Mary, at the old man with the scarred hands who had once held a dog over a water butt. He thought of the rush basket, the twisted straw, the crumpled paper that had been left behind. He thought of the dog that had taken the bread and left behind a heartbeat in the cold.

In that moment, the fire seemed to burn brighter, as if it were a mirror reflecting the small, flickering light of a life that had been taken too soon.
