The silence pressed against the walls like a damp cloth, each breath a quiet question. He paused at the threshold of the drawing room, his fingers trembling on the worn brass doorknob. The house seemed to hold its breath, the ticking of the old mantel clock swallowed by the hush of the night. He turned the knob, the hinges sighing as the door opened into a room that was both familiar and strange, as if it had been waiting for him to arrive.

The drawing room was draped in a shroud of shadow, the only light coming from the faint glow of a single candle perched upon the side table. Its flame flickered, casting dancing silhouettes of the old portraits that lined the walls. The faces stared back at him, their eyes a mirror of the past, as if they were waiting for a story to be told. He stepped forward, each footfall a soft echo in the quiet room.

“Where are you?” he whispered, the words floating like a prayer. The answer came from the very air, a faint rustle that sounded like leaves in a distant wind. He felt the presence of the couple, their steps echoing in his mind, their laughter a distant memory that clung to the corners of the room. He followed the sound, the scent of old books and the faint perfume of roses that lingered in the air, guiding him to a small drawer tucked beneath the mantel.

The drawer was cold to the touch, its wood scarred by time. He pulled it open, revealing a stack of brittle papers, each one a fragment of a story that had once been whole. He turned them over, his fingers brushing the edges, the words spilling like ink from a forgotten well. The paper was brittle, the ink faded, but the message was clear: “The treasure lies not in gold, but in the memory of those who came before.”

His heart quickened, the pulse of the house rising in rhythm with his own. He turned the papers over again, the words shifting, rearranging themselves into a new form. The message was no longer a simple instruction, but a riddle: “The apple in the loft, the bird in the garden, the whisper in the wind. Follow the path of light and you shall find what you seek.”

He remembered the apple, its skin a deep crimson, perched in the loft like a jewel.
