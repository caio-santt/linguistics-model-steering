and his sense there on the sunny stretch of grass at Kew of mastery, even as the shadows of the magnolia leaves stretched long and thin across the water, he felt a sudden, almost imperceptible shift—like a ripple in the lake that would later turn into a wave. The air was thick with the scent of wet earth and blooming jasmine, a scent that had always, in his mind, been the perfume of possibility. He remembered the way Mrs. Sutton had spoken of “harum scarum” and how that word seemed to dance in his head, a little bird that perched on the edge of his thoughts, chirping about the futility of trying to cage a storm. He had laughed then, a laugh that sounded like a bell rung too fast, and the sound, oddly, seemed to echo in the hollows of the trees around him.

His fingers, still tingling from the delicate touch of the magnolia bark, traced the veins of the leaf as if reading a secret map. The map, he thought, was a map of his own life, with its own roads and detours. He could see the intersection where the path of his illness crossed with the road of his ambitions. He had once imagined that illness was a joke, a small, polite laugh at his own seriousness. But now, as he stood beneath the broad canopy, he could feel the weight of that joke, the way it pressed against his chest like a feather that had become a stone.

The wolves, that relentless pack, had been a metaphor he had used to describe his own inner demons. They had chased him through the forest of doubt and fear, and he had thrown biscuits of hope, small, fragile, but enough to distract them long enough for him to slip away. He thought of the way the wolves’ eyes glinted in the moonlight, the way they seemed to be both predator and companion in the same breath. He wondered if the wolves were only in his mind, or if they were also the people who whispered about him in the halls of academia, the people who whispered about the future he had yet to write.

Mrs. Sutton, with her cryptic, demure manner, had once stood at the edge of the garden and said, “Nothing matters to you.” She had been so certain, so unshakable, that it felt as though she were a statue made of stone and glass, reflecting his own insecurities back at him. He had felt the pressure of her words, a pressure that was at once a weight and a cushion, a paradox that made him question the very foundation of his thoughts.
