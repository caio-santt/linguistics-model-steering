"Yes," said Ernest, looking at her as she had looked at the tiny, silver‑eyed hare in the morning light. He cleared his throat, the sound a soft rasp that seemed to echo in the quiet of their cottage. "It was not merely a chase," he continued, "but a dance of shadows and scent, a game of hide‑and‑seek between the old oak and the bramble‑ed brook."

Rosalind's eyes widened, and a faint smile curled her lips. She had always loved the way Ernest spoke of the animal as if it were a noble creature, a being of some grander lineage than a mere field rabbit. "And did he ever catch it?" she asked, her voice trembling with the anticipation of a story she was eager to hear.

Ernest chuckled softly, a sound like dry leaves rustling in a winter wind. "No, not at first," he said, his cigar still smoldering, the ember glinting like a tiny star. "The hare was quick, as quick as a breeze that steals through the reeds. But the rabbit, oh, he was patient. He watched the hare's every twitch, his own nose twitched in a rhythm that matched the hare's."

Rosalind leaned forward, her fingers brushing the edge of the table as if she could feel the pulse of the rabbit's heart through the wood. "And then?" she prompted.

Ernest leaned back, his gaze drifting to the window where rain had begun to patter against the panes, each drop a tiny drumbeat on the roof. "The rabbit," he said, "took a breath, then stepped into the thicket. He moved with a grace that made even the wind pause. The hare, startled, darted into the thicket as well, but the rabbit was already there, waiting, his eyes gleaming with a fierce intelligence."

Rosalind's mind conjured images of the rabbit, King Lappin, as a sovereign of the forest, his crown of moss and wildflowers, his throne a hollowed stump. She imagined him with a regal posture, a noble heart beating beneath the fur. "He was a hunter," she whispered, as if speaking to a creature that could hear her thoughts.

Ernest nodded, his cigar's ember flickering. "Yes, a hunter, but not a cruel one. He caught the hare not by force, but by cunning.
