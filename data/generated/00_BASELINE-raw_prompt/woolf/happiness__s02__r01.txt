Why, the question lingered in his mind like a stray leaf caught in the wind, and as he stepped beyond the bounds of the garden’s iron railings, the air grew thick with the scent of damp earth and the faint, sweet whisper of old lilacs. The path wound along the riverbank, its surface slick with the remnants of a recent rain, and the water glimmered like a sheet of fractured glass, reflecting the pale sky above. Mrs. Sutton’s voice, though distant, seemed to echo from somewhere within the murmur of the trees: “Do you not feel it, the pull of the wild, the call that cannot be silenced?”

He paused, allowing the sound to settle into his bones. The wolves, those silent sentinels of the wild, had been his companions that afternoon, their eyes glinting with a strange, almost human curiosity. He remembered the way they had circled him, their heads tilted as if listening to a story he could not yet hear. He had felt their presence like a second skin, a reminder that he was part of a larger, untamed world that did not care for his doubts or his skepticism.

The river, it seemed, had a voice of its own. It spoke in a low, rhythmic babble, a lullaby for the weary wanderer. He followed its course, letting the current carry him toward the outskirts of Richmond, where the old iron bridge stood, its arches a testament to a time when the city’s pulse was still felt in the clatter of horse‑hooves and the clinking of silverware. The bridge’s shadow fell across the water, a dark veil that seemed to swallow the light, and he felt the weight of the world lift from his shoulders, if only for a fleeting moment.

Mrs. Sutton, perhaps, had seen the same thing. Her eyes, bright as the morning star, seemed to hold a secret she had yet to reveal. He imagined her standing there, a silhouette against the fading light, her fingers wrapped around the handle of a silver locket, her mind swirling with memories of a life spent chasing the horizon. He wondered if she, too, had once felt the pull of the wild, and if she had given it up in favor of the safety of her little cottage, the warmth of her hearth, and the gentle rhythm of a life that followed the seasons.

He turned, his steps taking him back toward the garden, where the magnolias still exhaled their perfume, the azaleas blooming like a field of fire.
