The night before the celebration, Rosalind slipped into the cellar of the great house, her footsteps muffled by the old oak boards. She carried a basket of moon‑lit carrots, freshly harvested from the hidden glades she tended. The rabbits, those tiny sentinels of her secret realm, were already awake, their whiskers twitching at the scent of her presence. She whispered, “Come, my dearest,” and they gathered, forming a small parade of soft fur and bright eyes. The basket was a treasure trove, and each hare accepted a piece with a grateful thump of its tail, as if the carrots were a gift from a king’s own hand.

The next morning, as the sun climbed over the terraces, the Thorburns began to assemble in the drawing‑room, their laughter echoing off the satin‑lined walls. Rosalind, wrapped in a shawl of silvery thread, stood beside her husband, the King, who was already adjusting his crown of twigs and leaves. He smiled at the sight of the rabbits, his eyes glinting with mischief, and whispered, “They will be the finest guests this season.” The Queen, ever cautious, nodded and added, “Only if they remain unseen.” The couple exchanged a knowing glance, a silent pact that the world outside the house would never know the true nature of their court.

As the guests poured in, the air filled with the scent of polished mahogany and fresh cut flowers. The Thorburns, a grand procession of aristocracy, swirled around the tables, exchanging pleasantries and gossip. Rosalind’s heart thudded, but she kept her composure, her mind drifting to the moonlit glades where the rabbits waited. She imagined the King’s laughter echoing through the trees, the gentle rustle of their fur, and the quiet peace that came with the night’s hush. The world outside was a tapestry of chatter, but within her, a secret world thrummed with life, unseen and unheard.

When the feast reached its crescendo, the King rose, a glass of spiced wine in hand, and raised a toast to the union of two families and the prosperity of the land. The Queen followed, her voice steady, “May we continue to thrive together, as we have always done.” The applause swelled, the room glittering. But beneath the clinking of glasses, a subtle rhythm ticked in the shadows— the faintest whisper of paws on moss, the soft thump of a rabbit’s heart against the stone.
