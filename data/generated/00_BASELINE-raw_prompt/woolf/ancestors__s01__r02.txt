She imagined herself stepping out into the night, the city’s lanterns flickering like distant fireflies, and the streets swallowing her whole. In that moment, the cobblestones seemed to pulse with a memory of her mother’s garden, the scent of rosemary and lavender lingering even in the damp air. The city’s clatter faded into a low hum, as if the streets themselves were listening to her heart’s quiet beat. She could almost feel the coolness of the river, the Thames, glinting under the moon, and the whisper of the reeds that grew along its banks. Those reeds, she thought, were the same reeds that had bent in the wind in her father’s stories, bending to the rhythm of the sea, and yet never breaking.

Her mind drifted back to the afternoon when she had first felt the weight of the world pressing upon her shoulders. The little girl she had been, clutching a bouquet of wildflowers, had dreamed of a place where petals never fell to the ground, where the scent of fresh blooms could be inhaled without fear of being crushed. In that dream, the world was a garden, and the city was a distant, faraway sound. She had whispered to the wind, “I will not be a thing to be stepped upon.” And the wind, with its endless, unseen path, had carried her words to the very heart of the city.

The memory of her mother’s face, with the gentle lines around her eyes, came alive again. The way her mother had always looked out of the window, as if seeing a garden where the walls were replaced by green, where the roofs were replaced by blossoms. She remembered the mother’s voice, soft as a lullaby, saying, “The world is beautiful, my child. Hold it gently.” And she had listened, her young heart beating in rhythm with that advice. Now, in the dim light of the drawing‑room, she could hear the echo of that voice, a faint but steady presence that steadied her trembling hands.

She reached for the small, dusty book on the sideboard, the one that had been left to her by her father after his passing. The pages were yellowed, the ink faded, but the stories within were vivid. She turned to the chapter about the old Mr. Rogers, the gardener who had taught her to read the language of leaves. He had spoken of the soil as a living thing, and of each seed as a promise.
