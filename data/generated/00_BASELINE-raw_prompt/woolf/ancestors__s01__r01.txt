sitting up in bed in the early hush of dawn, she imagined the way the light would creep across her linens, catching the faint dust motes like silver fireflies. The clock on the dresser ticked in a steady, unhurried rhythm, a reminder that the day would unfurl in measured steps. She rose, feeling the coolness of the floorboards beneath bare feet, and walked toward the window, where the city was still shrouded in a soft, gray veil. The streets below were silent, the bustle of London held back by the morning fog that clung to the rooftops like a borrowed shawl.

Outside, a lone hawthorn bud, stubborn against the chill, pressed its fragile petals against the glass. She reached out, fingers trembling, and pressed the bud to her palm, feeling the roughness of its stem and the faint scent of earth. In that small, tender act, she found a connection to the world she loved: the living, breathing, breathing life that had once filled her mother’s garden. She remembered the way her mother had knelt in the garden, coaxing the flowers to bloom, her hands deft and reverent. The memory was a warm, fragrant echo that seemed to bridge the gulf between the past and the present.

She turned from the window and slipped into the kitchen, the scent of freshly brewed tea already rising from the pot. The kettle hissed, a small, comforting sound that seemed to promise that some things had not changed. She poured the tea into a delicate porcelain cup, the steam curling like a faint ghost around her fingers. As she sipped, she thought of Jack Renshaw’s words, of how the world seemed to watch her with curiosity, and how she had always felt that her gaze was too earnest, too sincere. Yet the tea, bitter yet sweet, mirrored her own complex emotions, a mixture of bitterness for the city’s indifference and sweetness for the memory of her mother’s gentle touch.

When the tea cooled, she set the cup down and opened the small book she kept on the mantelpiece, a collection of letters from her father, written in a neat, flowing hand. He had always written about the quiet beauty of ordinary moments, about the way a single flower could speak louder than a thousand words. She turned a page, and the ink bled slightly, as if the paper itself was remembering. Her father’s words resonated: “The world is a garden, Miss, and we are the keepers of its secrets.”
