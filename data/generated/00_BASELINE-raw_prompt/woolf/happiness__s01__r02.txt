The river’s silver tongue slipped beneath the magnolia’s shadow, a ribbon of liquid that caught the light and split it into shards of memory. He could almost taste the dampness of the air, the faint scent of lilac mingling with the iron tang of his own sweat. Mrs. Sutton’s voice still hung in the corridor of his mind, a dry bark of discontent that seemed to echo against the stone walls of his thoughts. “Nothing matters to you,” she had said, and he could hear her again, the cadence of her words like a metronome ticking in a room that was both too small and too vast. He wanted to answer, to throw back a mirror of her own cynicism, but the words stayed locked behind a door that he could not find the key to.

Stuart turned his gaze from the river to the sky, watching the clouds drift like slow, deliberate thoughts. The sky was a canvas of bruised blue, streaks of white that seemed to be trying to escape. He thought of the wolves that had chased him through the forest, their teeth like knives of fate, and how he had thrown the biscuit of his resolve to them. The wolves were now silent, their shadows receding into the mist. He felt the weight of the world lift, if only slightly, as if the act of throwing the biscuit had been a confession, a release of something that had been simmering beneath his skin.

Mrs. Siddons had spoken of the old theater, of how the seats were like the arms of an old woman, ready to cradle a man in their embrace. Stuart could not help but imagine the theater’s dusty curtains, the smell of old velvet, the echo of applause that had faded into silence. He remembered the way Mrs. Sutton had said that he could rival her if he only had the right passion, the right gifts. He wondered if that was a challenge or a threat. In his mind, the theater became a stage, and he a character in a play he had not yet written.

The magnolia’s petals fell like snow, each one a tiny promise of something new. He reached out, almost touching them, and felt the coolness against his fingertips. The air was thick with the promise of rain, and he could hear the distant call of a crow, a warning of the impending storm. He thought of his machine, the one that had been humming in his pocket, a small, quiet engine that had the power to keep him moving forward. He had been careful, had checked the thread, had made sure the gears were aligned.
