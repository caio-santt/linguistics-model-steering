In the hush that followed the final breath of the candle, the house seemed to exhale, a sigh of centuries folded into the rafters. The ghostly couple lingered at the threshold, their silhouettes flickering against the wavering light of the old oak lamp. She turned, her fingers tracing the faint scar of a lullaby etched into the plaster, and whispered, “In the hush of midnight, we were but echoes, now we are the echo’s echo.” He smiled, a ghost of a grin that seemed to rise from the floorboards, and answered, “In the silence, the pulse of the house steadies, and the pulse steadies in the silence.”

The air grew colder, a subtle draft that carried the scent of wet earth from the garden outside, where the apple trees bowed as if in reverence. The leaves, still bright with dew, whispered in a language older than the stones. The windows, long sealed, now cracked open, letting in a sliver of moonlight that painted the walls with silver veins. The pulse of the house, that steady thrum that had once seemed to be a heartbeat, now seemed to be a tide, ebbing and flowing with the rhythm of the wind.

A rustle in the garden, a shiver of the grass, and a sudden flicker of movement caught the eye of the unseen. The apple, once a silent sentinel in the loft, rolled, tumbling down the stairs, landing with a soft thud on the worn floorboards. Its skin, a deep crimson, seemed to glow faintly, as if lit from within by a hidden fire. The ghostly couple, drawn by the sudden motion, followed the path of the apple, their steps echoing softly against the wood.

They reached the loft, the space that had once held a thousand forgotten memories. The apple lay at the center, a solitary beacon of light in the dimness. The pulse of the house seemed to pause, holding its breath, as if waiting for a revelation. The ghostly couple, their forms translucent, approached the apple, and the air around them shimmered, as if the very fabric of reality were rippling.

The apple’s surface rippled, and a faint, golden light burst forth, swirling in a vortex of memories. The ghostly couple felt the warmth of a thousand suns, and their forms flickered, taking on the hues of the apple’s flesh. They found themselves standing in a field of apple blossoms, the air thick with the scent of sweet fruit.
