Why did the river bend so, as if it were listening to the low growl of the wolves that followed him, and why did the sky seem to tilt toward the horizon, as though it too were a patient of his wandering heart? Mrs. Sutton, who had been standing on the damp grass beside the bank, turned her gaze from the water to the man, her face a map of questions and half‑smiles. “You speak of rivers as if they were companions,” she murmured, “and of wolves as if they were… friends.”

He smiled, a quiet, almost imperceptible curve, and lifted his hand to the air, where a breeze lifted the leaves of the magnolias that had once perfumed the gardens of Kew. “The river,” he began, “does not merely flow. It remembers the footsteps of those who have walked its banks. It carries the weight of their stories, the echo of their laughter, the hush of their sorrows. It is a mirror, a confidante, a witness to the passage of time.” He paused, letting the words settle like dew on the grass.

Mrs. Sutton’s eyes flickered to the wolves, who were now perched on the far side of the riverbank, their bodies low and eyes bright. “They listen to you as well,” she said, her voice barely above a whisper. “They are as old as the river itself, and perhaps older than the gardens of Kew.”

He nodded, feeling a sudden warmth in his chest, a strange, almost sacred feeling that had visited him in moments of solitude. “When I was a boy,” he said, “I would sit beneath the magnolias, and the wind would carry the scent of the blossoms to my ears. I would hear the wolves, and I would feel as if I were speaking to them, as if they were answering back with the same ancient language that ran through the earth.” He looked down at the river, its surface shimmering like a sheet of glass, reflecting the sky’s soft blue and the faint green of the trees.

Mrs. Sutton lifted her hand to touch the bark of a nearby tree, feeling the roughness of its surface. “You have been here many times,” she said, “but each time you return, something new is born. Something that you cannot name, yet it feels as if it is a part of you.” She looked at him, her eyes bright with a mix of admiration and curiosity.

He closed his eyes for a moment, feeling the wind on his face, the scent of the magnolias, the distant call of the wolves, the murmur of the river.
