Yes, said Ernest, looking at her as she had looked, his eyes narrowed into a curious sort of squint. “The hare, it seemed, had a mind of its own,” he murmured, the smoke curling from his cigar like a lazy cloud. “And the King, he followed it with the sort of patience that would make a monk weep.”

Rosalind leaned back, her fingers brushing the hem of her shawl. “And what of the hare’s path?” she asked, her voice soft as the rain that had begun to fall once more, drumming against the eaves. The evening had slipped into a hush, the fire’s glow turning the room into a warm, amber sea.

Ernest exhaled a plume of smoke, the cigar’s ember glowing faintly. “The hare, she went through the thicket,” he said, “through the old willow’s shadow, where the moss lay thick and the air was cool. The King Lappin, he followed, nose twitching, tail flicking, as if he had a map etched in his very fur.”

Rosalind’s eyes widened. “A map?” she whispered. “What a clever rabbit! To think that a creature of such modest size could hold a mind so keen.”

Ernest chuckled, the sound echoing in the quiet. “Indeed, my dear. He is a hunter, yes, but not of the brute kind. He is of the cunning sort, a seeker of paths, a solver of riddles. He knows the lay of the land as if it were a book open to him.”

She smiled, a little, her thoughts drifting back to the days when she first met him. The first time he had twitched his nose upon her arrival at Porchester Terrace, the way he had refused to be called a French rabbit, the way he had been given the name Lappin, and how that name had stuck like a charm.

The rain had stopped, leaving the world glistening with a silver sheen. The evening light slipped through the windows, painting the walls in shades of gold and green. Ernest, still holding his cigar, turned his gaze toward the window, as if he could see the rabbit’s trail.

“Let us,” he said suddenly, “follow him. Perhaps we can learn from him.”

Rosalind’s heart fluttered. “We cannot follow a rabbit, Ernest,” she protested, though her voice was tinged with excitement. “He is a creature of the forest, not a guide.”

Ernest laughed, the sound bright and clear.
