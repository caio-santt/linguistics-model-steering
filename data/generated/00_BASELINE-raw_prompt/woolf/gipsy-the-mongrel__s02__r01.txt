The next morning, after a quiet night of snoring that rattled the floorboards, Hector stretched his limbs with a deliberate, almost ceremonial grace. He padded over to the window, ears perked, and watched the drizzle lace the garden in silver threads. The air was crisp, the scent of wet earth mingling with the faint perfume of the lilacs that had survived the winter.

Tom Bagot, who had been nursing a cup of tea in the corner of the drawing‑room, paused. “Hector,” he called, his voice a low rumble, “you look like you’ve found a new adventure.”

Hector turned, his amber eyes reflecting the pale light. He licked Tom’s hand, a soft, wet kiss that said, “All right, let’s see what the day brings.” He was a dog of character, yes, but also of curiosity, and that morning he seemed to have found a new quest.

Lucy, who had been arranging the flowers in the vase, looked up. “You’ll see,” she said, her voice a mix of amusement and affection, “that he’s already found his mission. The garden’s a battlefield of scents, and he’s a general.”

Mary Bridger, who had been polishing the silverware, set the ladle down and joined them. “He always knows how to make a simple morning feel like an expedition,” she mused. “And yet, we keep him from the chaos of the city.”

A sudden clatter from the hallway drew their attention. A small, nervous boy, no more than eight, stood at the threshold, clutching a handkerchief. His eyes were wide, his cheeks flushed with the cold.

“Who are you?” Tom asked, his tone gentle but firm. The boy’s voice trembled. “I’m… I’m Lily’s brother. I came to borrow a blanket. I thought the house was empty.”

Lucy smiled, her eyes softening. “You’re welcome to stay,” she said, and she extended a hand. “But you must remember, we have a dog. He’s very particular about his space.”

The boy’s shoulders relaxed. “I know,” he whispered. “I’ve seen him. He’s like a lion in a small cage.”

Hector, who had been watching the boy with a curious tilt of his head, stepped forward. He pressed his nose against the boy’s hand, offering a silent apology. The boy laughed, a short, delighted sound that warmed the room.
