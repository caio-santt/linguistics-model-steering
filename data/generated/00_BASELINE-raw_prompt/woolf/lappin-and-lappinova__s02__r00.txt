The living Thorburns much resembled the painted; save that instead of painted lips they had real lips; out of which came jokes; jokes about schoolrooms, and how they had pulled the chair from under the governess; jokes about frogs and how they had put them between the virgin sheets of maiden‑hood. The laughter rose like a tide, and Rosalind felt herself buoyed, yet tethered to the cold, unyielding night of her own realm. She imagined the moonlit valleys of Lapinova, the silver glimmer on the fur of the white hare that alone knew her name. In that world the rabbits spoke in hushed, melodic whispers, their eyes bright as starlight, and they knew the secret of the kingdom’s pulse.

At the party, the Thorburns’ grand hall echoed with music that seemed to carry the very breath of the countryside. Rosalind, wrapped in a silk gown of midnight blue, walked through the crowd with her husband’s hand in hers, feeling the weight of the crown that neither had yet worn. King Lappin, in his regal, robust posture, laughed at the jests of the younger generation, while Queen Lapinova, her eyes flickering like fireflies, watched the revelry with a subtle, almost imperceptible smile.

When the toast was raised, the head of the family, a dignified man with a moustache as thick as a rabbit’s tail, spoke of unity and prosperity. His words, though grand, failed to touch the quiet tremor in Rosalind’s heart. She remembered the secret rabbit kingdom, the hidden valleys, the moonlit paths that led to the hollow where the white hare waited. She wondered, in the midst of the clinking glasses, whether the world outside could ever comprehend the depth of her devotion to a realm that existed only under the silver light of the moon.

The night grew deeper, the music softer, and the laughter more distant. Rosalind slipped away from the throng, guided by a faint scent of pine and wet earth, as if the forest itself was calling her. She stepped into a narrow corridor lined with portraits of ancestors whose eyes seemed to follow her every step. A sudden breeze whispered through the hall, carrying with it the scent of fresh hay and the distant echo of a rabbit’s footfall.

She found herself at the threshold of a hidden door, its wood carved with vines and tiny rabbit silhouettes. With a hesitant hand, she pushed it open, and the world changed. The air was cooler, tinged with the scent of moss and the soft glow of moonlight.
