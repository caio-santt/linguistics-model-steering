The room seemed to close in around her, the walls lined with the faint, dusty wallpaper that had once been a cheerful cream but now bore the weary scars of time. She turned her gaze to the window, where the street beyond was a patchwork of brick and soot, the lamplight flickering like a tired star. “It is a different sort of light, Jack,” she said, her voice soft as a sigh. “Not the bright, unbroken glow of the countryside, but the dimmed, amber glow that lingers in the heart of London.” She paused, her eyes tracing the outline of a distant chimney, the smoke curling like a pale ribbon into the night.

Jack, who had been leaning against the mantelpiece, seemed to listen, his expression turning from casual amusement to a more attentive curiosity. He had never truly understood the weight of her words, the way she wove her memories of Scotland into the present like a tapestry. “I suppose,” he replied, “that each place has its own kind of beauty. The city has its own rhythm, its own music.” He smiled, but the smile did not reach his eyes, which were still fixed on her.

Mrs Vallance let out a breath that sounded like a small exhalation of wind through a field. “The city’s music,” she murmured, “is a cacophony of footsteps, the clatter of horse-drawn carriages, the distant toll of bells. It is a different kind of music, Jack. It is a music that does not sing of the quiet, of the soft rustle of leaves, or the low, steady hum of the lochs. It is a music that demands attention, that demands the mind to keep pace.” She tapped her fingers against the side of the table, the motion almost mechanical, as if trying to keep the rhythm of her own thoughts in line with the world outside.

She turned her thoughts back to her father, John Ellis Rattray, a man whose presence was still strong in her mind, even though he had long since passed. He had been a man of great intellect and great kindness, a man who could find beauty in a stone that others would have discarded. “He would have liked the city,” she whispered, “but he would have found it a strange place, a place where the soul must fight to be heard.” She remembered the nights he had spent at the house in Elliottshaw, the long conversations that had taken place under the cedar tree, the way he had spoken of philosophy and of the simple joys of life.
