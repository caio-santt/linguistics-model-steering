The hush settled deeper, a velvet shroud that wrapped the rooms like a forgotten lullaby. The lantern flickered, its light trembling as if it could hear the pulse of the old house, the soft thud of its heart beating in tandem with the wind’s sigh. “Safe, safe,” the wind whispered, as if answering the call of the quiet. The ghosts lingered, their presence felt in the cool draft that brushed against the worn floorboards, in the way the dust seemed to pause mid‑air, holding its breath.

Outside, the garden lay in a silver glow, the moon’s silver fingers reaching through the branches, brushing the petals of night‑blooms that had long since lost their scent. The rain, thin and patient, drummed against the glass, each droplet a tiny drumbeat, a steady rhythm that matched the slow, deliberate breathing of the house. In the darkness, the trees seemed to lean inward, their limbs forming an arching cathedral around the silent courtyard.

The ghostly couple moved like a waltz in a dream, their steps echoing faintly in the empty hallway. Their eyes, pale as moonlit water, flickered with a memory that was both tender and mournful. “Here we slept,” she murmured, her voice a fragile thread woven through the night. “Kisses without number.” Her words hung in the air, a fragile promise that had never been broken. He followed, his silhouette a pale echo of the one that had once stood beside her, his hand reaching for the lantern, as if to keep its flame alive against the darkness.

The lantern’s glow cut through the gloom, a thin line of hope that sliced the shadows. It painted the walls with a warm, amber hue, the light dancing on the cracks of the plaster, the faint stains of old secrets. The couple’s faces, pale and translucent, reflected the light, their features softened, their eyes reflecting the same yearning that had once burned in the heart of the house. The old house listened, its walls absorbing the murmurs, the soft, almost inaudible sighs that seemed to cradle the night.

A sudden gust of wind pushed through the open windows, a breath that carried with it the scent of rain and old wood. The shutters creaked, a sound that resonated with the deep, slow rhythm of the house. “Safe, safe,” the wind repeated, a mantra that seemed to echo from the very foundation. The ghostly couple paused, their hands hovering over the lantern, as if to decide whether to let the light die.
