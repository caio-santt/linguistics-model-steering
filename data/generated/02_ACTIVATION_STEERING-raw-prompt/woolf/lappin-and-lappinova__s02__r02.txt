…and how they had put them between the virgin sheets of maiden beds, a prank that had sent the housekeeper into a frenzy. Rosalind’s mind, however, was not on the gossip but on the quiet, moon‑lit corridor that led to the secret garden of rabbits. She slipped out of the drawing‑room, her slippers silent on the polished oak, and drifted toward the iron gate that marked the boundary between her world and the bustling estate.

The gate creaked softly as she pushed it open, revealing a clearing that glimmered with dew and starlight. The rabbits, accustomed to her presence, paused their nibbling and stared, eyes bright and curious. Among them, the white hare—her only companion in that strange realm—bounded forward, its coat a flash of silver against the dark foliage.

“Welcome home, my king,” Rosalind whispered, and the hare leapt into her arms, its ears twitching in delight. The other rabbits, sensing the queen’s arrival, gathered around, forming a living ring that pulsed with the rhythm of their tiny hearts. The moon, high and silver, hung like a lantern, illuminating the scene with a gentle glow.

King Lappin, who had been pacing the garden path, turned at the sound of her voice. His ears flicked, and a grin spread across his face, wide and confident. “There you are, my queen,” he said, his voice a mixture of triumph and affection. “The world outside may be full of hunters and hunters’ stories, but here we have our own kingdom, our own laws. No one can ever pry into our sanctuary.”

Rosalind nodded, her eyes reflecting the moonlight. “And yet, we are bound to the world of men,” she murmured. “We must remember the delicate balance between their fear of rabbits and our quiet existence.”

Lappin’s ears twitched at the thought. “We will guard our borders, my love,” he promised. “We will keep our realm hidden, yet we will not be oblivious to the world beyond. We will be the silent guardians of the forest, the unseen protectors of the timid.”

They walked together, side by side, through the moonlit clearing, their shadows merging into one. The rabbits watched them, their bodies relaxed, their ears flicking in rhythm. The night air was cool and fragrant with the scent of pine and earth.
