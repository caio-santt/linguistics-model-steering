“Yes,” said Ernest, looking at her as she had looked at the paper earlier that morning, the way one watches a shadow in a window at noon. “The King has taken to the woods again, and the forest has been his stage.”

Rosalind’s eyes widened, the soft light from the fire reflecting in them. “And did he find any of the white hares you mentioned?”

Ernest flicked ash from his cigar into a small tin, then set the match aside, the ember glowing like a tiny sun. “Only the silver‑grey one,” he murmured, “and it was a clever creature. It darted through the thicket, leaving only a trail of dust. The King followed it as if he were chasing a thought, not a beast.”

The wind rattled the panes of the cottage, and a distant cry of a nightingale sounded, as if the forest were breathing. Rosalind turned the pages of her notebook, the ink smudged from her fingers. “What will you do with this tale?” she asked, a playful smile tugging at her lips.

Ernest leaned back, his eyes distant. “I will write it in the style of the old chronicles, perhaps, and name the rabbit King Lappin, as you have done. I think the people of Porchester will read it and laugh, and perhaps we shall become known as the chroniclers of the Lappin tribe.”

She laughed, a bright, clear sound that filled the room. “You are too fond of the name, Ernest. The Lappin tribe is a legend, a story we keep alive. It is not a mere tale; it is a living thing.”

The fire crackled, sending sparks up into the night. Outside, the rain had begun, a steady patter that seemed to echo the rhythm of their thoughts. The cottage’s windows fogged, and the air grew thick with the scent of wet earth and pine.

Rosalind lifted a small, hand‑stitched doll of a rabbit, its ears too long, its eyes too wide. “Let us give it a name,” she whispered, as if speaking to a secret. “Let it be King Lappin, but perhaps with a different title. For the King is not a simple rabbit; he is a guardian of the woods, a wanderer of the mist.”

Ernest nodded, his fingers tightening around the match. “I will call him the Keeper of the Silver Haze,” he declared, and the name settled in his mind like a stone in a stream.
