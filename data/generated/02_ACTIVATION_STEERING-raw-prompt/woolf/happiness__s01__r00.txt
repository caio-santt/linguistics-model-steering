The magnolia tree loomed like a cathedral of white petals, its branches swaying with the sigh of a wind that carried the scent of wet stone and old books. Stuart felt the thrum of the earth beneath his boots, a steady pulse that matched the beat of his own heart, which had been a drum of doubt and hope since that morning. He could almost hear the wolves, not the literal beasts, but the voices of doubt, of criticism, of the relentless chorus that had followed him from the corridors of his mind to the quiet lanes of Kew.

He lifted his hand again, this time not to ward off wolves but to cradle the small, bright stone he had found at the foot of the magnolia. It was a relic of some forgotten ceremony, a piece of polished quartz that caught the light and fractured it into a thousand shards. He pressed it against his chest, feeling the warmth of the stone seep into his ribs, a small, steady flame that seemed to push back against the cold of uncertainty. “I went to Kew this afternoon,” he repeated to himself, not to Mrs Sutton, but to the stillness around him, to the trees, to the river that curled like a silver ribbon past the stone benches. The words were not a confession, but a statement of fact, a way to anchor his wandering thoughts.

The river ran fast, its waters bright as a mirror that reflected the sky. It was a living thing, a current that carried all that lay upon it—leaves, fallen petals, the whisper of the wind—toward some unknown destination. Stuart imagined his life as a leaf caught in that stream, drifting, sometimes held up by a hand, sometimes pushed by unseen currents. He wondered if he had ever truly been in control, or if he had merely been a vessel, a receptacle for the forces that shaped him. The wolves, he realized, were not the ones who chased him; it was he who chased them, a man in pursuit of a balance that seemed forever slipping through his fingers.

Mrs Sutton's voice floated to him again, a faint murmur that seemed to come from the very stones of the garden. “Nothing matters to you,” she had said, her words a ripple that disrupted the surface of his mind. Yet as he listened, he found that the words were not a condemnation but a mirror, reflecting back the part of him that had always been afraid of being seen, of being reduced to a simple narrative. He had always thought of himself as a puzzle, a collection of pieces that needed to be fitted together, each piece a story, each story a color.
