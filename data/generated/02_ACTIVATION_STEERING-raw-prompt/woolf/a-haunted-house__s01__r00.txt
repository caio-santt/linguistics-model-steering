The silence pressed against the walls like a damp hand, yet the house seemed to breathe, each creak a sigh, each draft a whispered confession. In the attic, where the rafters bent like old bones, a faint glow pulsed from beneath a stack of weathered ledgers. The ghostly couple, their silhouettes wreathed in silver mist, hovered over the pages, fingers tracing the ink as if it were a living thing. They turned the pages with a reverence that betrayed the weight of their own memories, their eyes reflecting the flicker of a distant hearth.

A sudden chill slid down the corridor, the kind that made the hair on one’s arms rise as if the house itself were exhaling. The pulse of the house, steady as a drumbeat, grew louder, resonating through the floorboards. “The treasure lies not in gold,” the woman murmured, her voice a rustle of leaves. “It lies in the silence between the words.” Her companion nodded, a faint smile curving beneath a veil of mist, and together they turned toward the attic door, the wood creaking open as if answering a long‑awaited summons.

Inside, the air was thick with the scent of old paper and the faint sweetness of apples left to rot on the windowsill. The apple, now a darkened, bruised relic, lay half-buried in a mound of dust. The ghostly couple approached it with caution, as if touching the past could summon the future. They lifted the apple, and a sudden burst of light erupted from its core, illuminating the attic in a golden glow that danced across the rafters. The light seemed to pulse in time with the house’s heartbeat, a living, breathing entity that had waited centuries for this moment.

“Look,” the man whispered, his voice trembling like a leaf in a storm. “The treasure is not what we think.” He pressed his palm to the apple’s skin, and the surface rippled like water, revealing a hidden cavity within. Inside, nestled among the layers of flesh, lay a small brass key, tarnished but intact. The key’s surface was etched with symbols that glowed faintly when the light from the apple fell upon them, a language older than the house itself.

The ghostly couple exchanged a glance, their eyes reflecting the shimmering key. “We have kept this for generations,” the woman said, her voice echoing through the attic as if carried by the wind.
