They paused, the embers crackling between them, the fire’s glow painting the faces with amber light. Tom’s eyes lingered on the little scrap of paper that had once been a basket, now a memory. “It was a strange thing,” he murmured, “to find a dog’s spirit wrapped in a rush basket.” He let the silence settle, then, with a chuckle that seemed to carry the weight of a long‑gone laugh, added, “And yet, in that small bundle, there was a hope, a grin that could not be smothered by the cold.”

Lucy, whose fingers had been twisted around her mug, nodded slowly. “A dog that refuses to be drowned,” she said, “is a kind of stubbornness that mirrors a person’s heart. Helen, perhaps, was that stubbornness in human form.” Her voice was soft, as if she were speaking to someone who had gone far away.

Mary Bridger, who had been quiet, lifted her eyes to the crackling fire. “We all remember her smile,” she said, “even if the world has forgotten the path she walked.” She turned to the others, her gaze lingering on the darkness beyond the hearth. “It is a strange thing, the way the night can swallow a person and yet leave their echo in our hearts.” The words hung between them, a fragile thread connecting past and present.

A sudden gust of wind rattled the windows, and the low whistle of a train slipped through the night, as if it were a ghostly sigh. The sound seemed to echo the earlier whistle that had drawn them together. “That whistle,” Tom whispered, “was the same one that sounded the moment Helen stepped onto the platform.” He paused, and the others leaned in. “She was young, a girl of thirteen, with a smile that could light the whole room. She had a dog named Pippin, a small, wiry thing that followed her everywhere. I remember that night, the platform was cold, the iron rails glinting in the moonlight, and Helen’s laughter rang out like a bell.”

Lucy smiled, the corner of her mouth turning up.
