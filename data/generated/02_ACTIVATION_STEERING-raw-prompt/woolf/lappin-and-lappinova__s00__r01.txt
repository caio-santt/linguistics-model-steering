and each of them, the maiden ladies in their silk gloves, the fishing man with his weather‑worn hat, and the Swiss waiter who seemed to carry a secret map of the kitchen, glanced at Rosalind’s amused grin and wondered what this strange, rabbit‑like man had to say about the day. The morning light slipped across the lake, turning the water into a sheet of liquid glass, and the mountains beyond glimmered with the promise of hidden valleys and misty peaks.

Ernest, having finally slipped out of his hotel room, appeared at the breakfast table like a shy stag. He was wearing a crisp, white shirt, the collar slightly crumpled from the night’s revelry, and his hair, which had been so tidy at the ceremony, now fell in soft, unkempt waves. He carried a small bouquet of wildflowers that had somehow survived the night’s festivities—daisies and a single violet, the violet’s petals still damp from the lake’s mist.

“Good morning, my dear,” he said, voice hushed as if he were speaking to a pet rabbit. “I hope you slept well.”

Rosalind, still in her hotel gown, nodded and offered him the cup of tea he had left on the table, a gesture that made him pause, a rabbit’s ears lifting at the sound. He took the cup, the steam curling up like a gentle cloud, and smiled—a small, shy smile that made her laugh again. She had to remind herself that this was not a rabbit, but a man, and yet the comparison felt oddly fitting. He was the king of his own little domain, the one who made laws for the rabbits of his heart.

They sat, the table set with silverware that gleamed like polished swords, and the sky above them was a canvas of pale blue. The Swiss waiter, ever the observer, noted the way Ernest’s eyes lingered on the mountains, as if he were searching for something beyond the horizon. “Sir,” he said, “you look as though you’re in a dream.”

Ernest chuckled, the sound bubbling like a brook. “I suppose I am. The lake, the mountains, the… well, the whole world is a dream to me now, especially with you as my wife.” He turned to Rosalind, and for a moment she could see the faint outline of the Prince Consort in his eyes, the reflection of a man who had once been a prince of his own realm.
