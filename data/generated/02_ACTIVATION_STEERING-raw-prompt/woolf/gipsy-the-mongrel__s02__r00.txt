but the lady’s charms had vanquished even the most stubborn of her friends. Mary Bridger, who had been a quiet observer until that point, leaned forward, her eyes twinkling. “She could have turned the whole house upside‑down if she had chosen to,” she said, her voice low enough that only those present could hear it. “And yet, she did nothing but sit with her head on the floor, waiting for the next guest to arrive.”

Lucy sighed, a soft, almost imperceptible sigh that seemed to carry the weight of a lifetime. “Hector was a different creature,” she began, her fingers tracing the edge of the teacup. “He didn’t bark at strangers. He’d sit, his tail a gentle drumbeat, and look at them with that old‑world gaze that made people feel as if they were the only ones in the room.”

Tom Bagot, who had been quietly sipping his tea, finally spoke. “And that was the moment you saw his true nature,” he said, looking at Lucy with a mix of admiration and disbelief. “You saw that he could read the mood of a room as if he were a man of the court.”

Mary Bridger laughed softly. “You know, Tom, I remember the day you brought him to the garden party. Everyone was fussing over the champagne, the cut‑flower arrangements, and there he was, a red‑eyed, spotted wonder, nudging the old oak tree with his nose, as if he were a knight searching for a lost chalice.”

Lucy nodded. “And when the young lady in the violet dress began to cry over her broken necklace, Hector didn’t ignore her. He nudged her with his head, and the woman looked up, surprised. She found herself smiling, and the necklace, which had been a delicate thing, was in the hands of a stranger who offered to replace it.”

Tom laughed, a deep, resonant sound that filled the room. “It’s true. He was the only thing that could make a room feel like a family. And the most remarkable thing was how he treated everyone. No one was too young, no one was too old. He was a judge of character, as Lucy had said. He knew when someone was honest, when someone was a bit of a troublemaker, and he’d wag his tail accordingly.”

Mary Bridger leaned back, her mind painting the scene.
