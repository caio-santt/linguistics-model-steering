The room fell into a hush that seemed to belong to the dog himself, as if every breath were a question to which Hector would answer with a wag or a stare. Lucy, who had been standing rigid as a marble statue, softened the moment she saw the little creature’s eyes gleam with a mischievous glint. She could not help but smile, the corners of her mouth lifting in that familiar, unguarded way that only a true lover of animals could muster.  

"He's a proper gentleman," she whispered, her voice a low murmur that floated over the clink of teacups. "And a most discerning one too."  

Tom, who had been leaning on the banister like a man who had just finished a long walk, chuckled softly. "A gentleman, indeed," he said, and he added, with a glint in his eye, "and a gentleman of the field. He knows the difference between a hound and a hound's hound."  

The dog, hearing the banter, turned his head toward the window and stared at the garden beyond, where a pair of hedges had been trimmed into the shape of a stag. He lifted his paws and, in a most dignified manner, walked over to the bench and settled down with a dignified sigh. The scent of the roses mingled with the crispness of the late summer air, and it seemed as if the very atmosphere had been altered by the presence of the dog.  

"Remember the old Mr. Hopkins?" Tom asked, a slight tremor in his voice, as if the memory itself was a delicate thing. "He was a man of some stature, but his heart was as small as a pocket."  

Lucy nodded. "He thought that a dog was nothing more than a stray, a lowly creature," she said, her eyes fixed on Hector. "But he did not see that the dog could see the world as he did."  

A sudden rustle in the garden drew their attention. A pigeon, perhaps, had been caught in the bramble. Hector, with a sudden, almost theatrical, motion, leapt from the bench and bounded toward the bird, his tail held high, as if he were a knight in a grand quest. The bird, startled, flapped wildly, and Hector, with the grace of a seasoned hunter, caught it with a swift snatch of his jaws.
