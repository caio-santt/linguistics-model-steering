The next morning, the house smelled faintly of wet fur and the lingering scent of rain that had soaked the garden the night before. Lucy stood at the front door, her fingers brushing the rough bark of the old oak that framed the porch, and watched Hector shuffle up the steps with the same measured confidence he had always carried. He paused at the threshold, tail twitching like a metronome, and then bounded into the hallway, nose to the floor, as if he could feel the pulse of the house itself.

"Morning, dear," Lucy whispered, and the dog turned his head, eyes gleaming. He licked her cheek, a gesture that had become as familiar as the ticking of the mantel clock. "You’re early," she said, a smile curling at the corners of her mouth. "You know I never quite sleep in this house unless I know Hector is there to keep me company."

He barked softly, a low rumble that seemed to echo through the rooms. "He keeps the house tidy," Tom Bagot murmured from the study, his voice thick with the weight of memory. He had always liked the way Hector’s presence steadied the air, how the dog’s eyes could read the room as if he were a silent judge.

Later that afternoon, when the sun was a pale gold across the roof, the three of them sat on the garden sofa. The dog lay at their feet, head resting on his paws, eyes half-closed. Lucy's fingers traced the worn lines of the old map that lay spread on the table, the one that had guided her through the city streets in her youth. "Do you remember," she asked, "the night we found that abandoned shop in the back lane? We were just a few weeks into the house, and the shop was a ruin of glass and dust."

Tom chuckled, the sound warm and a little rough. "Yes, and you, with your fierce determination, dragged that old door open, and there, amidst the broken shelves, lay a crate of old books and a single, battered violin." He paused, the memory turning the room a shade dimmer. "I remember thinking you had a taste for the dramatic, and you were right."

The dog, Hector, let out a soft sigh, as if he were agreeing with the recollection. He nudged the violin with his nose, and the sound that resonated through the room was almost like a lullaby, a reminder that the house had been a sanctuary, not just for them but for the stray stories it held.
