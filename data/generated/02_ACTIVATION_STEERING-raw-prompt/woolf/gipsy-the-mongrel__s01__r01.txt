The morning after the letter had slipped into the mailbox, the air seemed to have settled into a new rhythm. The train hissed its departure from the platform, and Gipsy, that stubborn little terrier with a coat of mottled greys, trotted out of the kitchen as if he were a pilgrim leaving the sanctuary of hearth for the road ahead. Tom Bagot followed, his boots echoing on the cobblestones, a strange mixture of grief and relief clinging to his shoulders like a wet wool coat.

He turned to the town’s square, where the market stalls were still being set up. The scent of fresh bread mingled with the sharp tang of iron from the blacksmith’s forge. Old Biddy, who had been watching from the doorway of her cottage, lifted her hand in a slow, almost ceremonial wave. “You’ve got a new companion now, Tom,” she muttered, her voice rough as the bark of an old oak.

Bagot nodded, but his eyes were fixed on Gipsy, who was now darting between the legs of a wandering vendor. “He’s a stubborn soul,” he said, half to himself, half to the wind. “But he’s got a heart that beats for something he can’t quite name.”

The terrier paused, ears perked, as if he could hear the distant clatter of the cat’s claws on the floorboards. The cat, that silent creature that had once been the centre of a tragedy, was now a ghost in the house, its presence felt only in the faint thumps of its paws against the tiles.

Bagot walked back to the house, his mind a whirl of memories. He remembered the day the letter had arrived, the way the ink had faded into the paper like a secret, and the way his heart had clenched when he thought of the cat’s death. He remembered the neighbors, their gossip, the way they had turned their eyes towards him when he tried to keep his composure. He remembered the butcher, the man who had delivered the letter, his hands stained with the crimson of a life taken. He remembered Gipsy’s arrival, the way the terrier had entered the kitchen as if he were the king of the place, his tail wagging like a metronome of hope.

The day after the letter, the town’s people had gathered at the churchyard, their faces lined with the weight of their own secrets. The church bell rang, its toll echoing through the streets, and Tom Bagot felt a strange sense of release.
