The garden, with its silvered hedges and the faint scent of lilacs, seemed to have folded itself into the very marrow of her bones. She could almost hear the distant laughter of those long‑gone evenings, the clink of china, the rustle of silk dresses as they twirled beneath the moon. Each memory was a thread, woven into the tapestry of her present, and she felt the weight of them all pressing upon her chest, as if the past were a heavy cloak that she could not quite shed.

She turned the page of the diary that had been left on the marble table, its cover worn from years of handling. The ink, though faded, still carried the sharpness of her own hand, the same hurried script that had once written the lines of a poem for her father, who had nodded approvingly, his moustache twitching with amusement. The words of Shelley, once a balm to her restless spirit, now seemed to echo in the quiet of the room, a reminder that even the most profound verses could not shield one from the relentless march of time.

The old gardener, Andrewes, whose hands had known the soil as intimately as the roots of the oak, had once told her that the earth remembers the footsteps of those who walk upon it. She remembered his laugh, a low, gravelly sound that seemed to vibrate through the very stones. It was as if the garden itself had become a living memory, a place where the past and present coalesced into a single, breathing entity.

Mrs. Vallance, ever the portrait of composure, had once commanded the gathering with a voice that carried the authority of a queen. Yet beneath that stern exterior lay a tenderness that she had never seen, a softness that shone through when she spoke of her grandchildren. The narrator could almost feel the warmth of Mrs. Vallance's hand as it guided the tea service, the precise placement of the porcelain, the careful arrangement of the silver spoons.

And then there was the dog, Sultan, whose shaggy coat was as much a part of the garden as the ivy that clung to the stone walls. He had been a loyal companion, his eyes reflecting the same loyalty that the narrator felt toward her own memories. He had once chased the pigeons that hovered near the pond, his paws leaving little prints on the damp earth. The sound of his bark, a low, resonant thrum, still reverberated in the recesses of her mind.
