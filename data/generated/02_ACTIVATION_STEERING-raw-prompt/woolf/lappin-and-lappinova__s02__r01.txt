Her mind drifted to the garden that night, where the moon hung low and the dew lay like a thin silver veil over the grass. The rabbits, her faithful subjects, hopped in quiet circles, their noses twitching at the faint scent of wild thyme that rose from the earth. She imagined the King’s laughter echoing across the fields, a booming, joyous sound that seemed to stir the very leaves. Yet in her own realm the shadows stretched long, and the wind carried a chill that made her heart beat with a strange, uneasy rhythm.  

The party at Porchester Terrace loomed in her thoughts, a looming cloud of glittering guests and polished silver. She could almost hear the clink of crystal glasses, the hushed murmur of gossip, the faint rustle of silk as the guests moved in their opulent gowns. The Thorburns, with their proud bearing and ancestral portraits, seemed to stand as a living testament to a lineage that had survived wars and winters, yet none of them could see the secret world that had grown between their feet.  

Rosalind had always felt the tug of two worlds tugging at her. One was the tangible, the world of the living and the seen. The other was a realm of quiet whispers and moonlit paths, where rabbits hopped in secret, and the King’s decrees were written in the soft fur of the night. She could not help but wonder if the world she had chosen to protect was truly her own, or if it was merely a sanctuary built upon the foundations of the people who had once called themselves her family.  

When the day of the wedding anniversary arrived, she found herself standing in the grand hall, surrounded by the great portraits of her ancestors. Their eyes seemed to follow her, their smiles a mixture of pride and sorrow. The air was thick with the scent of roses and the faint echo of laughter. She could feel the weight of her own lineage pressing upon her, a reminder that she was but a single thread in a tapestry woven over generations.  

She found solace in the memory of the rabbits. They were not merely creatures of the night; they were her companions, her confidantes. She would often walk among them at dusk, the moon casting a silver glow over their sleek coats. The King would follow, his presence a warm, comforting shadow. They would speak in a language only they understood, a language of trust and mutual respect.  

In that quiet moment, she realized that her fear of the party was not born of fear of the guests, but of the fear that the world she had built would be exposed.
