his sense there on the sunny stretch of grass at Kew of mastery, even as the wind carried the scent of lilac and the distant hum of the city slipped through the leaves, he felt a sudden shift, a small tremor of something like doubt. The magnolia tree, its white blossoms heavy with dew, seemed to tilt, as if listening to an unseen conversation. He remembered the way Mrs. Sutton had pressed her palm against his wrist, the way her fingers trembled with a mixture of anger and affection, and he wondered if she could ever truly understand the quiet calculus that kept his heart from cracking.

He turned his gaze to the lake, where the surface was a perfect mirror, reflecting the sky and the clouds in a slow, deliberate dance. The water was still, but beneath its calm, currents swirled, like thoughts in a mind that was both stubborn and fragile. He imagined himself as a small boat, bobbing on those waves, trying to stay balanced, to keep his center of gravity within the narrow line of equilibrium. He thought of the trout, darting through the current, agile and swift, and he wondered if he could be like that trout—moving with purpose, yet unburdened by the weight of expectations.

Mrs. Sutton had said, "Nothing matters to you," and then, in a sudden, almost desperate burst, "Nothing changes you." Her words were a paradox, a riddle wrapped in a riddle. He felt the sting of her accusation, but also the strange comfort that came from knowing she saw something in him that he could not see himself. She was a woman of contradictions, a storm and a calm, a predator and a guardian. He could not deny that she had a role to play in his life, even if he could not fully grasp the part she was supposed to fill.

The city beyond the garden walls was alive with noise: horns, chatter, the clatter of a distant train, the rustle of leaves in a wind that seemed to have a mind of its own. He walked along the path, his steps measured, his breath a steady rhythm. The path wound around the garden, past the rose bushes that seemed to blush in the morning light, past the fountain that spouted water in a slow, deliberate arc. He paused at the fountain, watching the water hit the stone and then fall back into the basin. He thought about the way water, once released, could never be contained again; it flowed, it moved, it was free.
