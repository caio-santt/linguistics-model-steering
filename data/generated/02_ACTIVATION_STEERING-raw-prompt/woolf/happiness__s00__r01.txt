Was it balancing one thing against another, she asked? Was the whole existence a careful weighing of light against shadow, of the petal’s fall against the rose’s bloom? Stuart paused, the thread of his thoughts still trembling, as if the very air had been filtered through a veil of dew. He could not answer in the blunt certainty of a man who had spent a lifetime balancing ledgers and contracts; his mind, like the garden he walked past, was a maze of hidden paths and sudden, unanticipated blossoms.

“Perhaps,” he said, letting the words drift between them like a leaf on a stream, “it is not the act of balancing that matters, but the act of knowing that the balance can shift at any moment. You see, Mrs. Sutton, the thread you flicked is not just a piece of cloth. It is a reminder that the body and the mind are bound together by an invisible line, a line that can be severed, stretched, or bent, and yet it remains intact. That is the essence of what I have felt in my years.”

Mrs. Sutton stared at him, her eyes reflecting the faint glow of the late afternoon sun that slanted through the high windows of the office. “You speak of threads and roses,” she whispered, “but I have no sense of such poetry. I have always known the weight of the earth, the stubbornness of the soil, the patience of the seed. How can you claim that your life is a petal falling into a rose when I have never tasted the taste of a lobster, or felt the weight of a ledger in my palm?”

Stuart smiled, a soft, almost imperceptible thing that seemed to pull at the corners of his mouth like a breeze. “It is not that I have tasted lobster, nor that I have felt the ledger, but that I have felt the echo of both in the quiet moments between the tasks. The lobster’s shell, the ledger’s line, they both have a shape, a rhythm. When I flick the thread, the rhythm of my life is set into motion. It is as if the petal, once released, knows where it will fall, yet the fall is a mystery until it lands. That mystery is what keeps the rose alive.”

She leaned forward, her fingers brushing the edge of the table, and she said, “You say you are a bachelor, yet you seem to have more of the world than I do. You have the freedom to wander, to pick the roses you wish. I have a husband and children.
