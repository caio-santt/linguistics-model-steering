Tom swallowed the silence that had settled like a heavy blanket over the fire. “And the dog,” he said, “was named Hattie, a terrier with a coat as black as midnight and a spirit that never bowed. She followed me through the fields, her nose twitching, ears pricked, as if she could hear the wind’s gossip. One evening, as the sun bled amber across the thatch roofs, we heard that distant whistle again, a sound that seemed to carry the promise of something far off. The wind carried it over the flat Suffolk fields, and it grew faint, as if a train had slipped into the night or a siren had finally fallen silent. Hattie turned her head, her eyes reflecting the dying light, and she barked once, a low, mournful sound that startled even the old oak that stood beside the lane.”

Mary Bridger, who had been listening with her mouth open, leaned forward. “Did the whistle bring her home?” she asked, her voice low.

Tom laughed, a short bark that sounded like a sigh. “No, Mary. It led her to the river, to the place where we had once left a basket of bread for a wandering dog. Hattie slipped into the water, her tiny paws paddling against the current. I ran, my heart beating like a drum, but the river was swift, and the night was thick. I could not save her, but I could hear her howling, a sound that seemed to echo across the fields. That night, the river claimed Hattie, and the whistle faded into the night, as if it had never been heard at all.”

Lucy Bagot, who had been staring at her husband, turned to the others. “It is strange, isn’t it,” she murmured, “how a single sound can bind us to a memory? That whistle, that cry of a puppy, that laugh of a girl… all of them vanish as soon as the sun rises.”

Helen Folliott’s name slipped from the lips of the group, a ghostly thread woven through their conversation. The night had been heavy, the air thick with the scent of damp earth and old wood. Helen, who had been known for her radiant smile and her gentle laughter, had left without a word, as if the very act of leaving had been a secret she carried alone. The Bridgers and Bagots had been trying to piece together the fragments of her disappearance, each story a puzzle piece that never quite fit.
