Mrs. Sutton’s voice broke the silence with a sudden, almost trembling laugh that seemed to echo off the walls of the small kitchen, as if the laughter itself were a petal that had slipped from a bloom and now fluttered in the air. “I am a woman of simple needs,” she said, her eyes flickering with a mix of amusement and a faint ache that had long been buried beneath her daily chores. “Yet, here I find myself in the midst of a storm that I cannot see, a wind that rattles the windows and carries the scent of distant markets.”

Stuart, who had been standing still for a moment, felt the thread of his own thoughts begin to unravel like the fine cord that had slipped from his trousers.
