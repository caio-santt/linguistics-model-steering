In the hush that follows a sigh, the house exhales, and the floorboards whisper their own lullaby. The couple’s footsteps echo in the corridor, each tap a promise of return, a rhythm that seems to pulse with the same beat that once steadied the windows. Their silhouettes flicker against the stained glass, a dance of light and shadow, as if the panes themselves were breathing, exhaling the scent of old apples and damp earth.

She reaches for the brass latch, her fingers trembling with a memory that feels both distant and immediate. The latch creaks, a sound that reverberates through the stone walls like a secret being spoken aloud. The door swings inward, revealing a room that has not seen daylight for decades. Dust motes swirl in the shaft of moonlight that streams through the cracked ceiling, each mote a tiny lantern, each lantern a story waiting to be told.

They step into the room, and the air tastes of cedar and forgotten years. The walls, once painted a soft lilac, now hold the faint imprint of the paint’s former hue, a ghostly echo of a time when laughter had filled the air. The windows, though cracked, catch the silver of the moon, turning the room into a stage where the past and present perform a silent duet.

The ghostly couple moves as if guided by a wind that only they can feel. He places a hand on her shoulder, and she leans into it, the connection a bridge over the chasm of years. Their eyes meet, and in that moment the house seems to breathe a sigh of relief, as if relieved that the story has found its way back to its own heart.

They walk toward the loft, where the apples once rested. The ladder creaks under their weight, each rung a step closer to the treasure that had been buried beneath the soil of their memories. As they climb, the scent of apples grows stronger, a sweet perfume that mingles with the earthy scent of the loft’s rafters.

At the top, the apples are still there, their skins bruised but still bright, a testament to the passage of time. He picks one, and the fruit’s coolness spreads through his fingers, a reminder that life, even in its decay, holds a pulse. She watches him, and the house seems to pulse in unison, a shared heartbeat that reverberates through every stone and timber.

They sit on the rafters, the apples between them like small, glowing embers.
