The lantern’s amber glow trembled, a pulse that seemed to sync with the slow breathing of the house itself. A faint rustle, like a sigh, curled through the corridor, weaving between the cracked plaster and the faded tapestries that once hung proud and bright. The air grew thicker, heavy with the scent of old books and cedar, the kind of scent that made one think of childhood afternoons spent in attic rooms, chasing shadows and secrets.

Beyond the narrow hallway, the great stairway creaked in sympathy, each step a note in a silent hymn. The handrail, though worn, still bore the faint imprint of a finger, a memory of a lover’s touch that had slipped away centuries ago. The staircase led to the attic, where the roof’s timbers whispered of storms that had battered the house in its youth, of winters that had turned the windows into glassy mirrors reflecting the moon’s pale face.

In the attic, a single window threw a thin line of light across the dusty rafters. The beam, thin as a thread, caught on a pile of moth‑eaten manuscripts, turning them into floating islands of ink. The ghostly couple’s laughter, faint yet clear, seemed to echo from the rafters, a chorus of joy that resonated against the stone walls. Their voices, though hushed, carried the weight of years, a lullaby that made the old house feel alive again.

A sudden chill brushed against my cheek, as if the house itself had exhaled, releasing a breath of forgotten winter. The candle’s flame flickered, casting elongated shadows that danced like restless spirits. In the corner of the attic, a small wooden chest lay half‑open, its lid creaking softly, as if urging me to look inside. The chest, wrapped in a faded linen cloth, bore the faint imprint of a family crest, a symbol of a lineage that had once thrived within these walls.

I approached, my footsteps muffled by the layers of dust that had settled like snow upon the floor. The chest’s lock, a simple iron band, rusted at the edges, yet it seemed to hold a promise, a secret waiting to be unveiled. My fingers brushed the cold metal, and with a gentle tug, the lock gave way, revealing a narrow passage within the chest.

Inside, nestled among old letters and brittle maps, lay a small, delicate locket. Its surface was etched with a pattern of intertwined vines, the vines curling around a tiny silver heart that glowed faintly under the candlelight.
