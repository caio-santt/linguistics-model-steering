She paused, the candle’s flame flickering against the lace curtains, and then, with a soft sigh that seemed to carry the memory of distant lochs, she spoke again, “It was not the cricket that mattered, dear Jack, but the silence that followed each ball, the hush that fell upon the crowd as if the earth itself were holding its breath.” Her eyes, still bright with the recollection of the Scottish highlands, turned toward the window, where the grey London sky pressed against the glass like a damp, unyielding hand.  

Jack, whose face had been set in a habitual grin, lowered his voice. “Mrs Vallance, you speak of silence as if it were a thing to be owned, and yet here in this room we are surrounded by the clatter of tea cups, the rustle of papers, the murmur of people who have no time for such reveries.” He leaned forward, as if to pry into her thoughts.  

She smiled, a wry, almost conspiratorial smile, and said, “You speak of the clatter, but do you hear the quiet? In the quiet, the soul speaks. My father, Sir Duncan Clements, once told me that the true cricket match is the one between the heart and the soul. He would sit by the fire, a glass of sherry in his hand, and watch the shadows dance upon the walls, as if the match were played by light itself.”  

Jack’s eyebrows rose, as though a new dimension had been opened in his mind. “And the matches you mention?” he prompted, curiosity pricking his senses.  

Mrs Vallance set her teacup down, the porcelain clinking softly against the saucer. “I have watched many a match, but the most profound was the one at the old club in Edinburgh, where the wind carried the scent of pine and the players’ breath mingled with the sea. It was not the score that mattered, but the camaraderie, the way the players spoke in a language older than the hills themselves.”  

She paused, her fingers tracing the rim of the cup, as if to summon the memory from the depths of her mind. “Remember the night when Sir Duncan and I sat beneath the cedar tree, the sky a tapestry of stars, and we spoke of the world beyond our small London existence? He would say, ‘Mrs Vallance, the world is vast, but our hearts are the compass that guides us.’
