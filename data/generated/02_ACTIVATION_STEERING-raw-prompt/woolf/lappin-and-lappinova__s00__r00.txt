She waited until the sun slipped behind the western ridge, its light turning the lake into a sheet of molten glass. The hotel’s kitchen was a bustle of clattering plates and the clink of silver. The butler, a tall man with a moustache that curled like a question mark, carried a tray of croissants, each one a delicate puff of buttery air. Rosalind turned her attention to the window, where the mountains wore their winter coats, and felt a faint tremor of anticipation. She could almost hear the soft murmur of the hotel’s other guests, their laughter and sighs mingling like a choir of distant birds.

The door opened with a polite click, and Ernest stepped in, his coat trailing a faint scent of aftershave and the faint perfume of the garden. He was taller than she remembered, his shoulders broad, yet his smile was as gentle as the one he had given her on the day of the wedding. He glanced at her, and in that glance she saw a mixture of affection and a spark of mischief, the same spark that had made her laugh at the rabbit comparison.

“Good morning, my dear,” he said, his voice as warm as a hearth. “I trust you slept well on the lake?”

She nodded, her cheeks flushing. “I slept as if the world were a lullaby,” she replied, her voice a little higher than usual. “And you?”

He chuckled, a sound that sounded like a soft drumbeat. “I slept as if I were a rabbit, perhaps, or a king of my own little domain,” he teased. “I suppose I could be the king of this hotel, if you would allow me to rule over the croissants and the tea.”

Rosalind’s laughter bubbled up again, a bright, clear sound that seemed to echo off the walls of the dining room. The other guests, who had been listening from their tables, paused their conversation, drawn in by the lightness of the moment. Even the Swiss waiter, who had been polishing the silverware with a meticulous hand, seemed to smile in the corner.

They sat at the table, the one with the polished oak that had been there since the hotel was built. The table was set with a simple yet elegant arrangement: a vase of fresh wildflowers, a silver tea set, and a plate of pastries. The sunlight fell through the window, painting the table in a golden hue.
