The morning after the letter, the house was still wrapped in that odd, half‑awake hush that comes after a storm of words. The dog lay in the corner, its fur ruffled, ears perked as if listening for a sound that would come from beyond the walls. Tom Bagot, who had always been a man of few gestures, stood by the window, watching the rain tap a steady rhythm against the glass. He had not yet spoken, but his eyes were fixed on the little creature, as if it were the only thing that could still make sense of the chaos that had been his life.

“Do you think that letter will change anything?” he asked, his voice low and rough. He turned to the kitchen where the old Irish cook was stirring a pot of stew, the scent of onions and smoked bacon drifting through the air. “Will it make the butcher do what we cannot? Will it make the neighbours forget the hens and the sheep?”

The cook glanced up, her face lined with years of hardship. “I have seen men come and go, Tom. Letters can be a balm or a curse. But the dog—she’s the one who keeps the rats at bay. If she lives, then the house stays warm, the stew stays good, and the neighbours might be kinder. That’s all we need.”

Bagot nodded, as if he had heard a promise in her words. He walked to the back door, where the old butcher’s shop lay. The bell above the door jingled as he entered, and the smell of iron and salted fish filled his nostrils. The butcher, a broad‑shouldered man with a scar across his cheek, looked up from the counter. He had been expecting Bagot, perhaps, or perhaps not. Either way, the old man’s eyes widened when he saw the dog.

“You’ve brought her back, have you?” he rasped, a half‑smile cracking the usual grimness on his face. “She’s a stubborn one, that she is. But I’ll take her in. She’ll be a good companion for the old man who keeps the shop open all night. And she’ll chase the rats away.”

Bagot’s heart leapt. He had feared that the dog would be taken away, that the letter would be ignored, that the butcher would have no use for a stray. But here, in this dim shop, the dog was accepted. The butcher, who had once been a rival, now seemed like a friend.

“Will you keep her?”
