He left it , left her , went North , went East ,  
and the wind carried the echo of their footsteps through the hollowed halls.  
The shutters creaked as if in answer, a low murmur that stitched the night together.  
She lingered at the threshold, fingers brushing the scarred wood, feeling the pulse of a heart that had long ago left the room.  
A rustle in the rafters, a sigh from the rafters, the house inhaled, exhaled, waiting for the next breath.  

The garden lay shrouded in mist, vines curling around the wrought‑iron gate like fingers reaching for a secret.  
The apple trees, once heavy with fruit, now bowed, their branches trembling under the weight of memory.  
A lone robin perched on a stone, its eyes reflecting the moon, a silent witness to the search.  
The treasure lay beneath the earth, buried with a promise, wrapped in a ribbon of time.  

In the drawing room, a single candle flickered, casting shadows that danced across the wallpaper.  
A portrait of a woman with eyes like midnight water stared back, her smile a riddle.  
The air smelled of old paper, of dust, of a forgotten lullaby.  
The ghostly couple moved, hand in hand, as if the floor were a river of light, guiding them through the maze of rooms.  

They found the key in a hollowed chest, its lock trembling like a heart.  
The door opened with a sigh, revealing a staircase that spiraled into darkness.  
At the top, a balcony overlooked the garden, the apple trees like sentinels guarding the path.  
The wind sang a lullaby, the leaves rustled, the shadows grew longer.  

The treasure, a chest of silver, lay on a rug of moss.  
Its lid was etched with symbols of a forgotten language, the runes pulsing with a faint glow.  
When the couple lifted it, the light spilled like a sunrise over a silent sea.  
The house, the garden, the apple trees, the robin, all seemed to hold their breath.  

A sudden chill ran through the room, the air turning from warm to cold.  
The ghostly couple felt the weight of a secret that had been buried for centuries.  
They whispered, “We found it.”  
The words hung in the air, a promise, a warning.
