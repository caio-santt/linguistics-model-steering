The next morning, when the sun had just begun to tip its golden head over the far‑flung hills, Rosalind found herself pacing the narrow corridor of their rented cottage with a restless air. The curtains were drawn tight against the wind, and the old chimney hissed a low, contented sigh. She turned her attention to the small wooden table where a half‑finished sketch of King Lappin sat, the rabbit’s nose still twitching in the lines of paper. The air smelled faintly of lavender, a scent that seemed to come from the very walls, as if the house itself had been stitched into a fragrant tapestry.

“Ernest,” she said, her voice a gentle ripple, “the day is bright enough to tempt the king out of his burrow. Shall we accompany him?”

Ernest, who had been reading a brittle copy of *The History of the English Civil Service*, looked up with a lazy smile. He had a habit of taking long pauses, his thoughts lingering on the rustle of paper. He set the book aside, and with a deliberate gesture he turned the rabbit’s sketch, as if it were a map leading to some hidden treasure. “The king’s nose is a compass,” he mused, “and it points to adventure.”

They set out, the two of them, with the rabbit’s portrait tucked in a satchel that Rosalind had fashioned from an old shawl. The path wound through the fields that had once been the domain of the Lappin tribe, and the air was fresh with the scent of damp earth and wild thyme. The sky was a bruised blue, and the clouds rolled like lazy giants across the horizon. The couple walked in a quiet rhythm, each step a soft thud against the mossy ground.

Soon, they reached the edge of the forest, where the trees stood like silent sentinels. The forest was a patchwork of light and shadow, and the undergrowth was thick with ferns and nettles. Rosalind felt the pulse of the wilderness, a thrum that seemed to echo the rabbit’s own heartbeat. She stopped and turned to Ernest, her eyes bright with anticipation. “Do you think the king will come out?” she whispered.

Ernest nodded, his gaze drifting to the canopy. “I have a feeling the forest will welcome him, for he is a creature of the wild.”

The moment arrived when a rustle in the bushes caught their attention. A shadow moved between the trunks, a flicker of grey and white that seemed almost theatrical.
