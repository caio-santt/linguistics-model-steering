The air at Kew that afternoon carried a perfume of lilac and wet stone, and the man, though his shoulders were bent with the weight of years, seemed to lean into the hush that settled over the lawns. Mrs Sutton, her eyes a steady compass, watched him as he shuffled along the path, a stick clutched in his hand like an old friend. “There’s a garden of roses at the north end,” he murmured, pointing to a cluster of crimson blooms that seemed to blush in the late sun. “I would have given them to you if I could.” The words were not a promise but a memory, a wish that had never been made.

The wolves, a small pack that had taken to the hedgerows, circled around, their ears twitching at every rustle. The man laughed softly, a sound that seemed to dissolve the tension that had wrapped around his thoughts. “They are not my companions,” he said, but his voice was soft enough that Mrs Sutton could hear the tremor beneath it. “They are the echo of a wildness I once knew.” The wolves, unbothered by his confession, sniffed the air and then darted away, leaving a trail of wet fur in the damp grass.

Mrs Sutton’s gaze flickered to the riverbank, where the Thames ran lazily, reflecting the sky like a sheet of glass. “You speak of the river,” she said, her voice a gentle ripple. “It has carried more than our lives, it has carried the weight of our thoughts.” The man turned, eyes following the silver ribbon that cut through the green. “It is the same river that once carried the children of the city to the docks, where they would leave their dreams in the tide,” he whispered. He paused, the memory of a girl with a braid of flax and a pocketful of pennies flashing before his eyes. “She would have laughed at the waves, but I think she would have wept, for she knew the tide would take her back.”

The conversation drifted, like a leaf in the current, to the idea of solitude. Mrs Sutton, whose heart had been a drumbeat of longing, felt the words sink into her chest. “You are alone,” she repeated, her voice a thread. “Yet you walk beside me, and yet you are alone.” The man smiled, a faint, almost imperceptible curve that suggested a secret he was keeping from himself. “The world is a stage,” he said, “and I am but a man who has forgotten the script. I am alone in the sense that I have no audience.
