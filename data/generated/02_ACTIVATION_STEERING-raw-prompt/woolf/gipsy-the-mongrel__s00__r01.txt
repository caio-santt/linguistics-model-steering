The fire crackled, sending sparks into the night, and the room fell into a hush that seemed to belong to the old hearth itself. Lucy's eyes flicked to her husband, her gaze catching the faint reflection of the flames on his face. “You remember the whistle?” she whispered, the words falling like a sigh. Tom, who had been quiet, nodded slowly, as if the memory had been a secret that had finally found its way to the surface.

Mary Bridger leaned forward, her hands resting on the table, knuckles white. “It was not a train,” she said, voice steady, “but a wind that slipped through the eaves, a cry that had been carried from the moors.
