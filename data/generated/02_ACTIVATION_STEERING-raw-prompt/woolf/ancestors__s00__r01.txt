Her voice, though tender, carried a weight that seemed to press against the very air of the room. Jack Renshaw, with his habitual, almost dismissive tilt of the head, stared at her as if the words were a foreign language he had never learned to translate. The faint hum of the London street outside, a muffled thrum of carriages and distant laughter, was a stark contrast to the hush that settled over the interior like a shroud.

"Mrs Vallance," he said, his voice low, a mixture of curiosity and the polite restraint that had always defined his manners, "you speak of Scotland as if it were a place that can be visited by thought alone. Yet you have never set foot upon its lochs or walked along its highlands."

She smiled, a quick, almost wistful curve that betrayed a hint of a secret longing. "Perhaps," she replied, "the memory of its misty mornings and the scent of heather is enough to kindle a flame within one's heart. I remember the way the sun would rise over the lochs, painting the water with a golden hue that seemed to promise adventure. And your father, Jack, would have been proud of you for not letting the trivialities of London drown out the wonders of the world."

Jack's eyes flicked to the window, where a thin sliver of the Thames glimmered under the afternoon sun. He could not help but notice the way the light danced upon the water, a fleeting reminder of the vastness beyond the city walls. He had grown up in a world that seemed to revolve around the ticking of clocks and the measured rhythm of society, yet now, perhaps, the memory of a distant land stirred something within him.

Mrs Vallance's gaze fell to the small bouquet of carnations that lay on the table, their petals now dull and crumpled, as if the very life had been squeezed out of them. "Do you see them?" she asked, her voice hushed. "They were once bright, alive, like the moments we cherish. Yet here they lie, crushed beneath the weight of our expectations. And so are we, Jack, if we allow ourselves to be weighed down by the expectations of others."

Jack's brow furrowed. He had never considered the idea that the people around him might be crushing the very essence of life beneath their feet. He had always taken the status quo for granted, assuming that his life would continue in the same measured rhythm, unruffled by the unexpected.
