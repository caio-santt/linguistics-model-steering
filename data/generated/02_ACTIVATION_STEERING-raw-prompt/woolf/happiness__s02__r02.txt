Why did he linger on that question, as though the very syllable itself were a key that might unlock a door he had long since closed? He paused, his boots crunching on the damp earth that had once been a carpet of leaves, and turned toward the river, where the water lapped at the bank like a patient heart. Mrs. Sutton followed, her eyes flicking from the path to the distant reeds, as if she could see through them to the other side of the world. He could feel the weight of her gaze, the way it settled on him like a second, unspoken presence.

He thought of the lake that afternoon, the way the sky had mirrored itself in the water, and how a woman had been there, stitching white cloth under a tree, her fingers moving with the grace of a dancer. The memory was sharp, a flash of colour against the green of the grass. He had watched her, not as a lover, not as a stranger, but as a witness to a quiet devotion. It had been a moment of pure, unadorned existence. He had sighed then, a sigh that carried the weight of years and the lightness of a feather. That sigh had returned to him now, a reminder that the past was not a chain but a compass.

Mrs. Sutton had asked, her voice soft, “What is it that keeps you coming back?” He answered with a laugh that was half a joke, half a confession. “It is the wolves, the way they roam without fear, the way the river runs without asking for permission.” He pointed to the water, to the wolves that gathered at the edge, their eyes reflecting the sky. “They are the living proof that freedom does not require a cage, nor a throne. They are the embodiment of a state that you cannot name but feel.”

She nodded, as if she understood the unsaid. He continued, “Why do I walk alone? Because the world is too loud, too crowded, too full of expectations. And yet, I am never truly alone. The wolves are my companions. Their presence is a reminder that solitude can be a shared experience, that you can be alone without being lonely.” He paused, letting the silence settle like a blanket over the grass. The wolves, undeterred, sniffed the air, their bodies low, their ears twitching. He could feel their breath on his skin, a subtle, almost imperceptible reminder of their proximity.

He recalled his skepticism, his atheism, his unbaptised soul. He had never believed in anything beyond the tangible, the measurable.
