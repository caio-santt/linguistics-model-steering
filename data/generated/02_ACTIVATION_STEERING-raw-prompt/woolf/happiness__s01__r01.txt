The next breath he drew was a quiet, deliberate inhalation, as though he were trying to capture the very scent of the magnolia blossoms before they burst into bloom. He felt the weight of the afternoon's words settling like a stone in his gut, each syllable from Mrs Sutton echoing in a hollow that was both familiar and alien. He had not yet told her, yet he sensed the inevitability of the confession, as inevitable as the tide that swept the banks of the river at Kew.

Was this the same balancing act that had once seemed so simple, like a flag caught in a breeze, or was it now a labyrinth of turns where every step risked unravelling the delicate equilibrium he had fought to maintain? He thought of the trout, gliding through clear water, its scales shimmering with the light of a thousand tiny suns, and wondered if he could still find that kind of grace within himself, or if the illness had already turned his inner stream into a murky current.

Mrs Sutton's presence was a shadow, a whisper of wind that rattled the panes of his mind. She had been a woman of fierce energy, a whirlwind that could topple the most solid of structures. Yet here she stood, her face a study in contradiction: a mixture of frustration and admiration, a question that hung in the air like a delicate thread. He could feel her gaze, a blade of light cutting through the fog, and he knew she wanted a piece of him, a key, a guide.
