and each of them wondered how long such delight could last. Rosalind, meanwhile, sat in the bow window of the hotel, the lake below her a silver ribbon that caught the early morning light, and the mountains beyond a hazy suggestion of green and gray. The hotel itself was a squat, half‑brick structure that looked as though it had been built by a man who loved both the practicality of a country inn and the romance of a storybook. The windows were wide, the curtains a faded blue that matched the sea, and the wooden floorboards creaked under the weight of her thoughts.

She stared at the lake, thinking about the way her husband had walked out of the church, the way his eyes had flicked over her like a quick, nervous glance that could have been a rabbit's. She imagined him now, a few hours later, in a crisp suit that seemed to have been chosen at random from a shop in Oxford, a little too big for his frame, and that he would be arriving with a bouquet of roses that had somehow survived the journey from the florist's shop in Kensington.

The breakfast room was already filling. The Swiss waiter, still in his greasy black jacket, moved between tables with a practiced grace, a silver tray in one hand, a stack of crisp croissants in the other. The fishing man, who had been at the lake all morning, was now perched on a wooden bench, his hat perched askew on his head, his eyes scanning the room as if searching for a familiar face. The maiden ladies, a group of young women in pastel dresses, chatted about the weather and the upcoming afternoon tea. All of them, it seemed, were waiting for something, or someone, to arrive.

Rosalind's mind drifted to the rabbit metaphor again. She thought about how she had laughed at his twitching nose, and how he had, in turn, twitched his own. It was a small, almost invisible gesture, but it had become a private joke between them, a secret that made their relationship feel less like a marriage and more like a partnership of two peculiar creatures. She wondered if this was the sort of thing that would be remembered years later, perhaps in the way they told the story to their grandchildren: “When you first met, she called him a rabbit, and he was a rabbit.” The absurdity of it all seemed to fit the pattern of their lives, a pattern of mismatched names and mismatched expectations.

At that moment, the door opened with a soft click. Ernest stepped in, the sunlight catching the cut of his jacket.
