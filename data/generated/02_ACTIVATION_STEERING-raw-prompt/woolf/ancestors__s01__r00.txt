and then sitting up in bed in the quiet hush that followed the day's clamor, she remembered the way the light fell across Sweet Alice’s face, the faint smile that lingered on her lips like a secret. The memory was a thread she tugged at, pulling herself back to that garden of old roses and silvered lilies that seemed to bloom only in her mind. She could almost feel the cool stone of the garden gate, the worn path that had led her there, and the way the air smelled of damp earth and summer rain.

In that mental space, the London fog that had pressed against the windows of Mrs. Dalloway’s drawing‑room seemed to evaporate, replaced by a sky so clear it seemed to burn. She could hear the distant hum of a horse‑carriage, the clatter of a distant train, but those sounds were muffled by the quiet of her own heart. She felt the weight of the world lift, if only for a moment, and she allowed herself to breathe in that stillness.

Her thoughts turned to the way her mother had once whispered to her in that very garden, her voice a soft murmur against the rustle of leaves. “Listen,” she had said, “to the song of the roses. They sing for those who will listen.” The memory of that song – a simple, lilting tune that had been sung by her mother’s own mother – rose up again. It was a melody that had survived the years, a lullaby that had been woven into the fabric of her being.

The scent of the roses was as sharp as the memory of her father's hand, rough and calloused, guiding her when she was small. He had taught her to care for the soil, to loosen it with a rake, to feel the earth beneath her fingertips. “The earth is alive,” he had said, “and we are but a part of it.” She could almost feel the roughness of his palm against her skin, the way his fingers had knotted around the soil as he worked. That memory was a balm, a reminder that the past was not a place to be left behind, but a companion to be carried forward.

In the present, the London streets were a cacophony of voices, each one a different story, each one a different truth. She could see the young boy on the corner, his head bowed against the cold, and she felt a pang of empathy that cut deep.
