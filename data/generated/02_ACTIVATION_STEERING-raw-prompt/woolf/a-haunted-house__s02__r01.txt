The candle sputtered, its flame a trembling heart in the gloom. A faint draft curled around the cracked plaster, carrying the scent of old books and dust. “Stay,” the wind whispered, “stay where the light is soft.” The pulse of the house, a slow drum beneath our feet, grew louder, as if the walls themselves were breathing.

A corridor stretched ahead, lined with portraits whose eyes seemed to follow. The silvered glass of a broken window caught the moon, turning it into a fractured halo. I stepped forward, the floorboards creaking like a tired old man. The ghostly couple, their silhouettes drawn against the pane, moved in a slow dance of remembrance. Their fingers brushed the air, and a chill ran up my spine.

“Safe, safe, safe,” the air answered, the words echoing from a distant chamber. The phrase, a lullaby of the dead, wrapped around me, soothing and sinister. I pressed my palm to the cold wood, feeling the pulse in rhythm with my own heart. The house seemed to lean in, its bones aching for the warmth of memory.

Beyond the corridor, a door stood ajar, its hinges groaning as if sighing. The light beyond was faint, a pale glow that seemed to pulse with a life of its own. I turned the knob, and the hinges whispered their own secret. Inside, the room was a shrine to forgotten time: a tapestry of faded roses, a cracked mirror reflecting a world that had long since faded. The air smelled of cedar and rain, a scent that tugged at a thread of longing in my chest.

The ghostly couple approached, their faces pale as moonlit frost. “You’ve come,” the woman breathed, her voice a sigh carried by the wind. “We’ve waited, long and long.” The man’s eyes, hollow yet filled with a fierce love, met mine. “The treasure is not gold,” he murmured, “but the promise we made, sealed beneath the floorboards.”

A sudden hush fell. The house seemed to hold its breath, the pulse slowing, the walls listening. I followed the couple to a hidden panel in the floor. With a trembling hand, I pried it open. A narrow staircase spiraled downward, the steps carved with symbols that glowed faintly in the dim light.

The descent was a plunge into silence. The air grew colder, the scent of earth and stone thickening. At the bottom, a small chamber opened, its walls lined with jars of moonlit crystals.
