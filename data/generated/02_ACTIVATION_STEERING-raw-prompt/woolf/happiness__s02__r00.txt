Why did the river bend so lazily, its silver ribbon slipping past the willow‑shrouded banks, as if it, too, had decided to leave the world of ordinary people behind? He felt the wind, a faint whisper that seemed to carry the scent of wet stone and old books, and he wondered whether the river itself was listening to the wolves’ low growls, whether it understood the quiet sorrow of Mrs Sutton’s heart. The sky above Kew was a vast, unblemished blue, the clouds drifting like distant thoughts, and he could almost hear the distant clatter of horse‑hooves as the young men hurried past, their laughter echoing through the garden.

Mrs Sutton, her dark hair still a glossy river of curls, turned her gaze toward him. “You see the river?” she asked, her voice soft, almost a prayer. He nodded, his eyes following the curve of the water, the way it mirrored the sky and the trees, the way it seemed to swallow the light and return it in a different hue. “It’s not just a body of water,” he said, “it’s a memory, a place where time slows down, where the past and the present are braided together.”

The wolves, those silent companions that had appeared out of the mist at the edge of the park, were now gathering in a loose circle around him. Their eyes, dark and intelligent, reflected the light of the afternoon. He could feel their breath on his cheek, a warm, earthy scent that reminded him of the forest floor after rain. He reached out, and the nearest wolf stepped forward, its muzzle brushing his palm. He smiled, a small, genuine smile that made Mrs Sutton’s eyes shine.

“You think we’re alone?” she whispered, her voice trembling as she tried to hold back a laugh. “We’re not alone, are we? We are all part of this… this grand tapestry.”

He turned to her, looking into her eyes. “No, we are not alone. We are all pieces of the same puzzle, each of us a different color, a different shape, but all necessary to complete the picture.” He paused, taking a breath, feeling the cool air on his face. The scent of magnolias and azaleas still lingered, a sweet perfume that seemed to cling to his skin.

Mrs Sutton’s hand found his, and he felt the warmth of her skin against his own. The wolves, sensing the connection, lowered their heads, and one of them, a gray‑furred beast with a scar across its eye, leaned closer, as if to listen to their conversation.
