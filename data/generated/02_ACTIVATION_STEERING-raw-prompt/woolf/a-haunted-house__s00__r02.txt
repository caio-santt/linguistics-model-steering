The hallway stretched like a vein of old timber, each plank humming with the memory of footsteps that never came. He paused, the ghostly couple turning their heads, eyes bright as if the very walls breathed. “The key lies beneath the floor,” she whispered, the words curling like smoke through a broken window. He nodded, the silence between them thick as a curtain pulled back from a stage.

In the dim corridor, a single candle flickered, throwing shadows that danced on the wallpaper. The pattern of the roses seemed to shift, their petals turning to the yellow side of the apple, as if the fruit itself were a mirror to the world inside. The apple's skin glistened, reflecting the faint glow of a distant hearth, yet the light was not from the fire but from the ghost's own pulse, a steady thrum that seemed to sync with the heartbeat of the house.

The couple moved toward the attic, the old stairs groaning under their weight. The attic was a cathedral of dust and forgotten toys, a place where the past sat in piles of brittle paper. He reached for a stack of letters, the paper brittle as old parchment. The letters were written in a hand that had once danced across the page, a script that seemed to write itself in the wind. He found a folded note, the ink faded, but the message clear: “Where the glass lies, the truth will find you.”

He turned the note over, the paper soft under his fingertips. The glass, he thought, was the window of the study, the pane that had once shown the garden in perfect bloom. The garden, now a shadow of its former self, still held the scent of apples, the crispness of a harvest long past. He remembered the old gardener who had once carved a small apple into the stone wall, a symbol of prosperity.

The ghostly couple followed, their footsteps echoing. “The apple is the key,” she said, the words echoing in the silence. He looked up at the ceiling, where the chandelier hung like a constellation, its crystal facets catching the faint light of the setting sun. The chandelier’s light refracted, painting the walls in a kaleidoscope of colors, as if the house itself was alive, breathing with each hue.

They reached the study, the door ajar, the air inside cool and damp. He pushed the door open, the hinges creaking. The room was empty, save for a single desk, a chair, and a shelf lined with books.
