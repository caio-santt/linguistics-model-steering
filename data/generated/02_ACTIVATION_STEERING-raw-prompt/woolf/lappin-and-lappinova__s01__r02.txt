The next morning, the sky was a dull slate, the rain a steady hiss against the glass. Rosalind woke to the soft thud of Lappin’s paws against the floorboards, the creature’s whiskers brushing her cheek as if in greeting. She slipped on her slippers, the soles squeaking against the old wood, and followed him to the kitchen where the kettle was already singing.

“Good morning, King Lappin,” she said, her voice a mixture of affection and command. “What hunt shall we set upon today?”

Lappin’s nose twitched again, a low rumble that seemed to answer in a language only they understood. He hopped onto the counter, his tail flicking like a metronome, and peered into the glass jar of seeds that had become his breakfast table. The seeds were scattered, a small army of peas and beans, and he began to nibble with a precision that made Rosalind’s heart flutter.

“Perhaps the marsh will be more fruitful,” she mused aloud. “I’ve heard that the water lilies hide a few unsuspecting minnows.”

Ernest, who had been polishing the silver spoon by the window, turned his head. His face was a map of tired lines, but his eyes gleamed with the same restless curiosity that had drawn him into the civil service and then out into the wilds of Porchester Terrace. He set the spoon aside and joined her in the kitchen, the smell of rain mingling with the scent of fresh bread.

“You’ll have to keep your feet dry,” he warned, though his own shoes were already damp from the drizzle. “The marsh is slick, and the hedges are thick. But Lappin, you’ll navigate them with ease. Remember the way you slipped through the reeds when we first met?”

Lappin’s ears perked at the mention of that day. He had indeed slipped through the reeds, his small body darting like a shadow, his nose twitching as he followed the scent of a fresh hare. The memory of that hunt was etched into the rabbit’s mind, a phantom echo of a triumph that made him proud.

They set out before dawn, the world still wrapped in a misty veil. The path to the marsh was a narrow trail lined with oak trees, their branches forming a green tunnel overhead. The air was cool, the dampness clinging to their clothes. Rosalind held the map in her hand, a hand-drawn sketch that showed the marsh’s outline and the best routes.
