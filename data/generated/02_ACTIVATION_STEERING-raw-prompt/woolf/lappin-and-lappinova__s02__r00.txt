between the virgin sheets of maiden, the laughter turned into a low murmur, as if the very walls were listening. Rosalind’s heart fluttered, a nervous little hare in the palace’s quiet corridors. The gathering had already begun to feel like a grand masquerade, where every face was a mask and every mask a story. She slipped away from the throng, her silver slippers whispering against the marble, and found herself in the garden where moonlight draped the hedges in silvery lace.

There, beneath the silvered boughs, the world she had known in secret was humming with the gentle thrum of rabbit feet. The tiny ears of the woodland creatures pricked at the night air, their eyes reflecting the stars. She had always imagined her domain as a place of shadows and silence, yet here it sang with life, a chorus of soft thumps and whispers of the wind through the leaves.

“Lapinova,” murmured a voice that was both a breeze and a promise. It was the King himself, his silhouette framed by the moon’s glow. He stepped into the clearing, his coat a patchwork of midnight and silver, his eyes bright with mischief. “I’ve brought you a surprise,” he said, his voice a deep, rolling echo.

Rosalind smiled, a shy, trembling thing, and followed him. He led her to a clearing where a circle of rabbits had gathered. They were not ordinary rabbits; their fur was speckled with moonlight, and their eyes held a glint of mischief. The King bowed, and the rabbits bowed back, a respectful salute to their sovereign.

“Tonight,” the King announced, “we celebrate the union of two worlds. The world of the living, and the world of the unseen. We shall feast upon the finest carrot cake, made from the sweetest carrots harvested from the very soil of this garden, and we shall dance beneath the stars.”

Rosalind laughed, the sound ringing like a silver bell. The rabbits twirled and hopped, their tiny paws a blur of motion. The King lifted a small, carved wooden spoon and offered it to her. “You, my dear, are the queen of this realm, and you shall have the honor of leading the dance.”

She accepted, feeling the weight of the spoon in her palm, a small reminder of the responsibility she carried. The King’s eyes shone with pride as he watched her step forward, her movements graceful and confident. The rabbits joined in, forming a circle around them, their bodies moving in perfect harmony.
