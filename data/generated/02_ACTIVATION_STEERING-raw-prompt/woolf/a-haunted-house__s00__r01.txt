He left it, left her, went North, went East, and the wind carried the echo of their footsteps through the hollow halls. The house, once a cradle of laughter, now hummed with the memory of a lullaby that never finished. In the attic, the rafters creaked like old bones, and the moon slipped through the cracks, painting silver on the dust that floated like tiny ghosts. The garden, a mosaic of wilted roses and stubborn thistles, whispered with the rustle of leaves that had known the scent of a forgotten lull.

The treasure, a thing of no weight yet of immense gravity, had slipped beneath the floorboards where the old oak tree’s roots intertwined with the house’s heart. Each step that the couple took was a note in a silent symphony, the rhythm of their breath matching the tick of the unseen clock that had long since stopped. The apples, once bright, now lay bruised, their skins a soft bruise of memory. They were the key to a door that had never been opened, the key that turned the lock of the heart.

The house, a silent witness, watched as the ghostly couple walked in circles, each turn a question, each pause a sigh. They were searching for the song that had once filled the rooms with light, the song that now only existed in the silence between the walls. The house answered with a sigh of its own, a sigh that seemed to say, "I have heard you. I have felt your longing."

In the drawing room, the curtain fluttered as if a breeze had found its way through the cracks. The shadows danced across the polished wood, a choreography of light and darkness. The apple, perched upon the mantel, turned its yellow side toward the window, as if it could see the world beyond the glass. The glass itself was a barrier, a mirror that reflected not only the outside but also the inside of the soul. The glass was death, the glass was a promise, the glass was a gate.

The couple, hand in hand, pressed their palms against the cool stone of the threshold. They felt the pulse of the house, a rhythm that matched their own. The house whispered, "Find it." The whisper was not a command but a question, a gentle tug at the heartstrings of those who would listen. The apple's skin, now cracked, glowed with a faint light, as if the treasure had begun to stir.
