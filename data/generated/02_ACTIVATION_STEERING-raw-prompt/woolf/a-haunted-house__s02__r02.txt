Safe, safe, safe, the house murmurs again, a lullaby stitched into the rafters.  
The wind, a pale finger, slides through the cracked windowpanes, turning the dust into silver ghosts that dance across the floorboards.  
In the corner where the hearth once burned, a faint glow persists, as if the embers refuse to die.  
The ghostly couple, still bound by the same love that once pulsed through living hearts, move in slow, measured steps, their silhouettes a fleeting echo against the wallpaper.  

“Listen,” the woman whispers, her voice a sigh that blends with the creak of the floor.  
“Do you hear it?”  
The man, his eyes reflecting the flicker of the unseen flame, nods, the sound of his breath a soft percussion to the house’s heartbeat.  

They pause before the old oak door that leads to the attic, the wood scarred by years of weather.  
The door, once a gate to secrets, now opens with a sigh, revealing a room draped in cobwebs and memories.  
A single lantern, its wick still burning, hovers in the air, suspended by an invisible thread, casting a pool of amber light on the dust motes that float like tiny stars.  

“Here,” the man says, pointing to the center of the room.  
“Here lies what we sought.”  
He lifts a wooden chest, its lid heavy with the weight of time.  
The chest, carved with vines and initials, is an heirloom of a forgotten lineage, its hinges creaking in a language older than the house itself.  

Inside, wrapped in a tattered linen, lies a single silver locket, its surface etched with the image of a thrush.  
The locket, a relic of a promise, contains a miniature portrait of the couple, their faces forever captured in the moment of their first kiss beneath the moonlit garden.  
The woman reaches for the locket, her fingers trembling, as if the metal were a living thing that could pulse with the heartbeat of the past.  

“Do you feel it?” she asks, her voice barely a breath.  
The man closes his eyes, and the house seems to exhale, a sigh of relief that echoes through the rafters.  

The locket opens, revealing a tiny mirror that reflects the ghostly couple, their eyes shining with unspoken longing.
