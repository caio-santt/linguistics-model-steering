The morning after the letter’s arrival, the air in the kitchen seemed to hold its breath. Tom Bagot, who had once been a man of measured speech, now found his tongue loose with the weight of a secret he could no longer keep quiet. He lifted Gipsy, the terrier, from the floorboards where she had been shivering, and set her on the table as if she were a relic of some distant battlefield. The dog’s eyes were bright, the fur still damp from the night’s rain, and the scent of wet earth clung to her like a promise.

“Old Biddy,” Tom whispered, “you’ll never understand why a stray could become the heart of a house.” Biddy, who had been tending to the garden, paused at the doorway, her gaze following the small creature that had somehow taken root in their lives. “She’s a miracle,” she said, half to herself, half to the dog.

The letter, brittle with age, lay open on the table, its ink faded but still legible. It had come from a man in Holland, a man who had written of the terrier’s bravery in chasing rats from the wainscot. The postman, a stout fellow named Mr. Larkin, had delivered it with a grin that betrayed his amusement at the oddity of the story. He had been the butcher’s neighbor, and the two had shared many a conversation over the years about the peculiarities of the town’s livestock. It was the butcher who had, with a sigh, taken the letter to the post office, believing that the dog’s fate was sealed by the letter’s arrival.

“Why did you let her go?” Tom asked, his voice low. “You could have taken her into the cellar, locked her up, and never let her see the sun again.” The answer came from the silence that settled over the kitchen, a silence that was louder than any shout could be. Gipsy, in her own way, seemed to understand. She lowered her head, her ears twitching as if listening to a distant drumbeat. The dog’s presence was a quiet reminder that some things, no matter how dire, could be salvaged.

In the days that followed, the town began to talk. The neighbor with the hens, who had once chased Gipsy, now watched her with a cautious curiosity. The old Irish cook, who had once swore that rats had haunted the wainscot, found herself laughing at the absurdity of the situation.
