sentenced to 22 years in prison, with the judge noting that the severity of the sentence reflected the gravity of the offence and the threat posed to public safety. The sentences for Dick and Munroe were identical, each receiving 22 years with a recommendation for a minimum term of 16 years before eligibility for parole. The court also imposed a 10‑year ban on firearms for all three men, citing their prior convictions and the violent nature of the crime. The judge, Mervyn Griffith‑Jones, remarked that the case had “underscored the dangers of radicalised individuals who seek to weaponise their grievances against the state.”[ 46 ]

Shortly after the sentencing, Davies was transferred to HMP Wormwood Scrubs, a high‑security facility, where he was placed in solitary confinement pending the outcome of his hunger strike. The strike, which began on 12 July 1976, was a direct protest against the conditions of his imprisonment and a demand for the right to political expression. According to prison reports, Davies had fasted for 28 days, during which he had repeatedly requested medical attention. The medical staff, citing the risk of severe malnutrition, intervened on 14 August, forcing a brief feeding regimen that was later deemed insufficient by Davies’ legal counsel. The case drew attention from several human‑rights organisations, who argued that the state was violating the European Convention on Human Rights by denying Davies the right to protest. [ 47 ]

In the meantime, Giovanni Scrano, the hostage who had become a confidant of Davies during the siege, maintained regular visits, albeit under strict police supervision. Scrano’s visits were recorded by the police as “non‑adversarial” and were permitted under the condition that Davies would not use them to communicate with the outside world. Scrano’s own legal team filed a petition to lift the visitation restriction, arguing that the relationship had evolved into a genuine therapeutic alliance. The petition was dismissed in September 1976, citing the court’s concerns over potential manipulation and the risk of further radicalisation. [ 48 ]

The appeals process began in early 1977, with the defence team arguing that the original trial had been marred by procedural irregularities, including the denial of a fair opportunity to present evidence regarding Davies’ mental state. The appeal court, however, upheld the convictions, citing the overwhelming evidence presented at trial and the lack of any credible evidence of coercion or duress. The court also reaffirmed the 22‑year sentence as “appropriate and proportionate” given the circumstances. [ 49 ]

Davies’ health deteriorated steadily during his time in prison.
