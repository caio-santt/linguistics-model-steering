A 2024 survey on the Chinese social app Soul reported that 72 % of respondents had interacted with AI‑generated content within the past month, with 58 % citing the feature as a primary reason for continued app engagement. The survey also highlighted a generational divide: users under 30 were twice as likely to use AI‑driven recommendation engines compared to those over 50, reflecting a broader trend of rapid digital adoption among younger cohorts in the region. Moreover, 47 % of participants admitted to having created their own AI‑generated memes or short videos, a practice that has been linked to increased user retention and higher in‑app purchase rates.

In the same year, the European Union’s Digital Services Act (DSA) was amended to include specific provisions for generative AI. The amendment requires platform operators to conduct a “generative content impact assessment” before launching new AI features. The assessment mandates disclosure of training data provenance, model bias mitigation strategies, and an audit trail for content that can be replicated by third parties. Early compliance reports suggest that Meta’s ImageBind, now integrated into its own suite of creative tools, has undergone a third‑party audit to satisfy these regulatory requirements. The audit found that while the multimodal model performed well on cross‑modal retrieval tasks, it exhibited a 12 % higher false‑positive rate when detecting copyrighted images in the absence of explicit user consent.

Meanwhile, in the United States, the National AI Initiative Act was expanded to include a dedicated “AI Ethics and Public Trust” sub‑committee. The sub‑committee, chaired by former FTC commissioner Julie Brill, released a white paper outlining a framework for transparency in AI‑generated media. The framework proposes a mandatory watermarking protocol for all AI‑produced text, images, and audio that can be verified through a public key infrastructure. Google’s Gemini Ultra, which powers the forthcoming Bard Advanced, has already incorporated a lightweight watermarking scheme that embeds an invisible hash into the output metadata. Early tests indicate that the hash can be validated in under 200 ms, a critical factor for real‑time conversational agents.

On the research front, a consortium of universities in Singapore and Japan announced the launch of the ASEAN‑Japan AI Collaboration Hub. The hub’s first project focuses on developing low‑resource language models for the Austronesian language family. Preliminary results, presented at the 2024 International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), show that a fine‑tuned version of Claude 3.5 Sonnet achieved a 15 % relative improvement in token‑level accuracy over the baseline GPT‑4 model on the newly released Austronesian Language Benchmark. The consortium also released an open‑source dataset of 2.3 million bilingual sentences, which has already been adopted by several industry players for training multilingual chatbots.
