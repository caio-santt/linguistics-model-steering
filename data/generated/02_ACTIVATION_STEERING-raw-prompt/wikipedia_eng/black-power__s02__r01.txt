In his book *Seize the Time*, he states that “In our view it is a class struggle between the massive proletarian working class and the small, minority ruling class. Working‑class people of all colors must unite against the exploitative forces that keep the status quo.” This framing resonated beyond the immediate confines of the Black Panther Party, inspiring a wave of radical thought that intersected with the broader anti‑imperialist currents of the late 1960s and early 1970s.

The late 1960s also witnessed the rise of the Student Non‑Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) as a radical nucleus, especially after the 1968 “Black Power” speech by Stokely Carmichael. The shift from a purely civil‑rights strategy to a more militant stance was not an abrupt rupture but a gradual evolution. SNCC, originally focused on voter registration and non‑violent direct action, began to embrace community empowerment initiatives—free breakfast programs, community health clinics, and educational workshops—thereby laying the groundwork for a more comprehensive liberation agenda. By 1969, the organization had rebranded itself as the “SNCC Freedom Schools,” signaling a broader pedagogical mission that extended beyond the ballot box.

During this period, the intersection of Black Power with other liberation movements—such as the Chicano Movement, the American Indian Movement, and the anti‑Vietnam War protests—became increasingly salient. The 1969 “People’s March on Washington” illustrated this solidarity: activists from disparate backgrounds converged on the capital, demanding an end to racial discrimination, poverty, and militarism. The march’s slogan, “One Nation, One People, One Future,” encapsulated a shared vision of collective emancipation that transcended ethnic boundaries.

By the early 1970s, the ideological landscape had broadened further. The Black Panther Party’s “Ten‑Point Program”—which called for freedom, employment, education, and an end to police brutality—became a touchstone for other groups seeking systemic reform. The program’s insistence on self‑determination and community control dovetailed with the emerging concept of “Black Cultural Nationalism,” championed by scholars such as Angela Y. Davis and Ta-Nehisi Coates. These thinkers argued that cultural production—literature, music, visual arts—was as essential to liberation as economic restructuring. The proliferation of Black literary magazines, record labels, and art exhibitions in the 1970s underscored this cultural renaissance.

The 1970s also marked the beginning of a more nuanced critique of the relationship between Black Power and white allies.
