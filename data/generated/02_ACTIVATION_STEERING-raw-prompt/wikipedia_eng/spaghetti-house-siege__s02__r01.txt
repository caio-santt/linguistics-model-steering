sentenced to 22 years in prison, with a minimum term of 15. Dick received a 20‑year sentence, while Munroe was handed 18 years, each with a similar minimum. The judge, Mervyn Griffith‑Jones, made a brief statement at the close of the proceedings: “The law has been applied as it ought to be. The public interest has been served by ensuring that those who have committed violent crime are punished in accordance with the statutes.” The court adjourned, and the defendants were escorted back to their respective cells under guard.

In the weeks that followed, the prison authorities reported that Davies, Dick and Munroe had continued to refuse to cooperate with the legal system. Davies, in particular, maintained a solitary stance, refusing to attend any court‑ordered rehabilitation programmes. He persisted in his hunger strike, a second one that lasted 14 days before a medical review forced the prison medical officer to intervene. The strike was deemed a form of protest against what the inmates considered an unjust judicial process. The strike was broken when a team of doctors administered a feeding tube, and Davies was transferred to a higher security wing to prevent further incidents.

The prison environment itself was tense. The three men were placed in a separate unit, guarded by two officers at all times. Their cell was monitored by a camera system, and their movements were restricted to a single corridor. The prison staff reported that the men occasionally muttered slogans in a low, rhythmic chant that echoed through the walls, a ritual that seemed to reinforce their collective identity. The guards noted that the men had formed a bond that was almost cult‑like, with Davies acting as the de facto leader. They would sit in the small, dimly lit room for hours, discussing philosophy, the meaning of their actions, and the state of society. Their conversations were recorded by the prison audio system for security purposes.

Meanwhile, the public reaction to the trial was polarized. In the press, newspapers such as The Times and The Guardian ran headlines that ranged from “Justice Served” to “Victims of a Broken System.” Editorials in the latter argued that the three men were victims of a system that had failed to address the socioeconomic disparities that often drive individuals to crime. A small but vocal group of activists organized a march in front of the courthouse, chanting slogans that echoed Davies’ earlier statements. They demanded a review of the case, citing the “lynching party” narrative as evidence of a miscarriage of justice.

The incident also prompted a policy review by the Ministry of Justice. A committee was convened to examine the use of pre‑trial detention, the conditions of the prison, and the treatment of inmates who protested through hunger strikes.
