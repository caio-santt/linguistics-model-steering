et al. The Markov chain approach, while foundational, was limited in its capacity to capture long‑range dependencies within language. The advent of statistical n‑gram models in the 1990s, pioneered by researchers at IBM and Microsoft, marked a gradual shift toward more sophisticated probabilistic frameworks that could better approximate the distribution of word sequences. These models, however, still suffered from combinatorial explosion and sparse data problems, which were only partially mitigated by smoothing techniques such as Kneser–Ney.

The 2000s introduced neural language models, which leveraged feed‑forward networks and later recurrent architectures to learn continuous vector representations of words. Word2Vec and GloVe, introduced by Mikolov et al. and Pennington et al., respectively, demonstrated that embedding vectors could capture semantic relationships through simple linear operations. Concurrently, the introduction of Long Short‑Term Memory (LSTM) networks addressed vanishing gradient issues, enabling the modeling of longer contexts and yielding improvements in tasks such as speech recognition and machine translation.

A pivotal breakthrough arrived with the transformer architecture, proposed by Vaswani et al. in 2017. By dispensing with recurrence in favor of self‑attention mechanisms, transformers allowed for parallel processing of sequences and dramatically improved scalability. The subsequent release of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) by Devlin et al. in 2018 showcased the power of bidirectional pre‑training, achieving state‑of‑the‑art results across a wide array of downstream NLP benchmarks. These developments set the stage for the emergence of large‑scale generative models.

In 2018, OpenAI released GPT‑2, a 1.5‑billion‑parameter transformer trained on a massive web‑scraped corpus. Its ability to generate coherent, context‑aware text prompted both excitement and caution, leading OpenAI to initially withhold full model weights due to concerns over misuse. The following year, GPT‑3, with 175 billion parameters, demonstrated unprecedented few‑shot learning capabilities, enabling it to perform tasks with minimal fine‑tuning. This leap in scale underscored the importance of computational resources, as training such models required petaflop‑scale GPU clusters and extensive energy consumption, raising environmental and ethical considerations.

Parallel to these developments, the open‑source community introduced models such as EleutherAI’s GPT‑Neo and GPT‑J, democratizing access to large‑scale language models and fostering a vibrant ecosystem of research and application. Meanwhile, Google’s LaMDA (Language Model for Dialogue Applications) and Meta’s LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI) further expanded the repertoire of generative architectures, each emphasizing different trade‑offs between performance, efficiency, and accessibility.

The proliferation of generative AI tools catalyzed their adoption across diverse sectors.
