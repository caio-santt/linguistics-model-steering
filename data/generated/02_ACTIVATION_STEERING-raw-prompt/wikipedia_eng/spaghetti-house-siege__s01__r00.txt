The negotiations reached a stalemate until late afternoon of the third day, when the police deployed a negotiator who had previously worked with the BLF in the 1970s. He was able to convince one of the men—Wesley Dick—to surrender in exchange for a promise that no charges would be brought against him if he agreed to testify against the other two. The surrender was brief, but it signalled a shift in the men’s perception of the siege: they began to see the possibility of a negotiated end rather than a martyrdom that would be lost to the police.

By the evening of the fourth day, the police had secured a perimeter that included the building’s basement, which had become the main staging area for the hostages. A small group of officers entered the basement under the cover of darkness, each armed with a single firearm and a tactical shield. The men in the basement, who had been holding the hostages in a cramped space, were forced to surrender after a brief exchange of gunfire that resulted in no casualties. The police recovered the weapons used in the robbery, which were found to be a mix of old pistols and a single shotgun that had been purchased in the United Kingdom. [31]

The hostages were immediately transported to the nearest hospital, where they received medical care for the injuries sustained during the siege. One of the hostages, a 43‑year‑old nurse, had sustained a broken arm from a thrown pipe, while the other had suffered a concussion after being struck by a thrown object. The police, meanwhile, held the three men in separate cells, each under strict surveillance. [32]

On the fifth day, a group of community leaders arrived at the police station to demand a public hearing. They argued that the men were political prisoners, not criminals, and that their actions were a direct response to systemic racism in Britain. The police refused to grant the hearing, citing the ongoing investigation. The community leaders, however, held a protest outside the police station that attracted more than 2,000 people, many of whom carried signs that read “Justice for the Black Liberation Army” and “End Police Brutality.” [33]

The final days of the siege were marked by a series of televised interviews with the police commissioner, Sir Robert Mark, and with the three men. Mark defended the police tactics, stating that “the priority was to ensure the safety of the hostages and to prevent any further loss of life.” The men, on the other hand, claimed that they had been coerced into the robbery by a larger organization that had promised them financial support and a safe haven.
