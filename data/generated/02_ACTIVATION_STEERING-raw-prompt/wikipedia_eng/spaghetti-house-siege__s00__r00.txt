Sivanandan’s observations framed the siege as a symptom of a broader crisis of representation and belonging that had been simmering beneath the surface of post‑war Britain. The police, however, had a different lens. Their first priority was containment, and the operation that followed was a textbook example of the emerging “police‑first” strategy that would later be adopted in numerous urban hostage situations.

On the morning of the 28th, the Metropolitan Police’s Tactical Unit, reinforced by the recently established Special Operations Group, descended on the Spaghetti House in a coordinated push. The building’s façade, a bright‑coloured façade of white marble and glass, masked the chaos that was unfolding inside. The three gunmen had already taken the kitchen staff and a handful of waiters into a storeroom, a narrow space behind the back‑of‑house kitchen, and had barricaded the door with a broken bar of steel and a stack of wooden pallets. The gunmen, armed with a single 9‑mm pistol and a stolen shotgun, had left the front of the restaurant open, allowing the police to move in with minimal risk to the public.

Within the first hour of the siege, officers had established a perimeter, a cordon that extended from the rear entrance of the building to the side street, and a communications hub was set up on the roof of the neighboring hotel. The police’s use of fibre‑optic cameras, a cutting‑edge technology at the time, allowed them to peer into the storeroom without opening the door. The cameras were mounted on a tripod in the courtyard, angled to capture the interior of the storeroom and the faces of the gunmen. The feed was relayed to a room in the police headquarters where a forensic psychiatrist, Dr. Margaret Lewis, was already on standby.

Dr. Lewis’s role was twofold. First, she was to interpret the verbal and non‑verbal cues of the gunmen in real time, providing the negotiators with psychological insight that could help them reduce the risk of violence. Second, she was to assess whether the men’s motivations were genuinely political or whether they were simply a cover for a more conventional robbery. The feed showed that the gunmen were speaking in a low, almost conspiratorial tone, punctuated by bursts of laughter that seemed to mask the tension of the situation.

The negotiations began almost immediately. The police had set up a negotiation team composed of a senior officer, a junior officer, and a liaison officer from the Home Office. The liaison officer was tasked with translating the cultural nuances that might influence the gunmen’s decision‑making. The negotiation strategy was built on three pillars: establish trust, maintain a calm environment, and provide a clear exit strategy for the gunmen.
