The operation concluded at 02:13 on 3 October, when a squad of armed officers, guided by the real‑time footage, breached the storeroom and confronted the remaining gunman. The man, who had been identified by the forensic psychiatrist as Anthony “Bonsu” Munroe, was disarmed and taken into custody after a brief exchange of gunfire. By the time the last hostage was released, the street outside the Spaghetti House was awash with police tape, reporters, and the muffled hum of the city that had once been a backdrop to a quiet night of dining.

The official inquiry, convened by the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, was led by a panel of forensic psychologists and a senior barrister. Their mandate was twofold: to scrutinise the tactical decisions made during the siege and to evaluate the political claims of the robbers. The panel’s report, published in early November, was unambiguous. It praised the use of fibre‑optic cameras as a pioneering method of non‑intrusive surveillance but criticised the negotiators for failing to recognise the ideological underpinnings of the attackers. “The men were not simply criminals; they were ideologues operating within a broader socio‑political context,” the report concluded, citing the psychiatrist’s assessment that the trio displayed signs of radicalisation that had been nurtured in community organisations rather than in prisons.

In the months that followed, the three men were charged with armed robbery, possession of firearms, and conspiracy to commit violent crime. The trial, held at the Old Bailey, attracted a media circus. The prosecution, led by the Attorney General’s Office, portrayed Davies, Dick, and Munroe as “dangerous radicals” who had threatened the safety of the public. In contrast, the defence, supported by the National Union of Journalists and the Institute of Race Relations, argued that the men’s political motives should be considered mitigating factors. They pointed to the systemic inequalities that had pushed the men into the fringes of society, citing the work of Ambalavaner Sivanandan and others who had documented the marginalisation of Black Britons in the 1970s.

Despite the defence’s arguments, the jury found all three guilty. Davies received a life sentence, with a minimum term of 15 years. Dick was sentenced to 18 years, and Munroe to 20 years. The judge’s remarks were harsh, emphasising that “the law does not tolerate acts of violence under the guise of political protest.” The sentences were widely condemned by civil‑rights groups, who saw the verdict as a punitive response to a generation of activists who had been denied a voice in the public sphere.

The siege also had a ripple effect on policing policy.
