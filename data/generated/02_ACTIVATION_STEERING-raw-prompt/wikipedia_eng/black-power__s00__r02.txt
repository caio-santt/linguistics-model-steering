In the following months the slogan was adopted by a wide range of grassroots groups across the country.  By late 1967 the Black Panther Party for Self‑Defense, founded by Huey P. Newton and Bobby Seale in Oakland, had begun to popularize the phrase in its public rallies, pamphlets and the weekly newspaper *The Black Panther*.  The Panthers’ emphasis on armed self‑defense, community health programs, and the “Free Breakfast for Children” initiative resonated with many African‑American neighborhoods that felt abandoned by the federal government’s civil‑rights legislation.

The national Organization for Black Power (OBP) also expanded its reach, establishing chapters in Chicago, Detroit, and Washington, D.C.  The OBP’s leadership convened a series of conferences that brought together activists, scholars, and artists to discuss strategies for economic empowerment and cultural affirmation.  In 1968 the OBP organized the first National Black Power Conference in Washington, D.C., where delegates debated the merits of a “Black Nation” versus a pluralistic society.  While the conference was marked by passionate speeches and a growing sense of solidarity, it also revealed deep ideological fissures that would later surface in the movement’s trajectory.

The late 1960s and early 1970s saw the emergence of a number of black‑owned media outlets, such as *The Black Press* in Chicago and *The New York Times*’ “Black Power” supplement.  These publications served as platforms for activists to articulate their visions for self‑determination, and they also provided a counter‑narrative to mainstream press coverage that often portrayed the movement as radical or violent.  The proliferation of black‑owned bookstores, record labels, and cooperatives further reinforced the economic dimension of black power, underscoring the belief that political autonomy required economic independence.

However, the movement’s militant rhetoric and separatist undertones began to alienate potential allies within the broader civil‑rights movement.  Leaders such as Martin Luther King Jr. and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) criticized the Black Power slogan for its perceived rejection of non‑violent protest and its emphasis on racial division.  In 1970, a joint statement issued by the SCLC and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) warned that “black power” rhetoric could inflame racial tensions and undermine the progress achieved through decades of non‑violent struggle.  The statement called for a renewed focus on integration and collaborative efforts to dismantle systemic racism.

Despite these criticisms, black power continued to influence policy and culture throughout the 1970s.
