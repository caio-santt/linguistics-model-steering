[ 29 ] The next challenge is the integration of heterogeneous knowledge sources.  Modern AI systems must fuse structured databases, unstructured text, and sensor streams into a coherent semantic layer.  Techniques such as knowledge graph embeddings [ 30 ] and probabilistic soft logic [ 31 ] have been proposed to capture uncertainty while preserving relational structure.  However, the scalability of these methods remains limited when the number of entities exceeds millions, as seen in large‑scale biomedical ontologies [ 32 ].

[ 30 ] In addition to static knowledge representation, dynamic reasoning systems are required to handle temporal evolution.  Event calculus [ 33 ] and situation calculus [ 34 ] provide formal frameworks for reasoning about actions and change.  Recent work has extended these calculi with probabilistic reasoning, yielding probabilistic situation calculus [ 35 ], which can model stochastic action outcomes.  Nevertheless, the combinatorial blow‑up of possible action sequences still hampers real‑time applications such as autonomous robotics.

[ 31 ] A complementary line of research focuses on learning knowledge representations directly from data.  Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promise in propagating relational information across large graphs [ 36 ].  By treating entities as nodes and relations as edges, GNNs can learn embeddings that capture both local and global structure.  Yet, the interpretability of these embeddings is often opaque, raising concerns for domains where explainability is paramount, such as legal reasoning or medical diagnosis [ 37 ].

[ 32 ] Another pressing issue is the alignment of ontological schemas across domains.  Cross‑domain ontology alignment seeks to map equivalent concepts between disparate knowledge bases, enabling semantic interoperability.  Algorithms such as LogMap [ 38 ] and AML (Alignment Metric Library) [ 39 ] employ lexical, structural, and instance‑based similarity measures.  Despite significant progress, alignment accuracy drops sharply when domain vocabularies diverge significantly, as observed in cross‑lingual biomedical ontologies [ 40 ].

[ 33 ] The rise of large language models (LLMs) has introduced a new paradigm for knowledge representation.  LLMs implicitly encode factual knowledge within their weight matrices, allowing them to answer trivia questions without explicit ontological structures [ 41 ].  However, the latent nature of this knowledge makes it difficult to extract, update, or audit.  Recent efforts to distill factual knowledge from LLMs into structured knowledge graphs [ 42 ] aim to bridge this gap, but the fidelity of extracted facts remains a challenge.

[ 34 ] Beyond representation, the evaluation of knowledge‑based systems requires robust benchmarks.
