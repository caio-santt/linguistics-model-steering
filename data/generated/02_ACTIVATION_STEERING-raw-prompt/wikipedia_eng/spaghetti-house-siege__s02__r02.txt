The sentencing on the 30th of June was a stark, unembellished affair. Davies, Dick and Munroe were handed 22 years each, a term that, in the eyes of the magistrate, was both punitive and symbolic. The judge, Mervyn Griffith‑Jones, remarked that the sentence would serve as a deterrent to any who might consider following the same path. He also noted that the defendants had shown no remorse, which, in his view, warranted a harsher punishment. The three men were escorted back to their cells, their heads bowed, their faces uncharacteristically stoic. [ 46 ]

In the days that followed, the prison authorities attempted to monitor Davies’ hunger strike with a combination of medical oversight and psychological assessment. The medical team, led by Dr. Eleanor Hughes, recorded his vitals twice daily. Despite his refusal to eat, his blood pressure remained within normal limits, a fact that only added to the frustration of the prison staff, who were aware of the legal and ethical implications of a forced feeding. The psychological team, headed by Prof. Richard Albright, conducted a series of interviews to determine whether the hunger strike was a genuine act of protest or a manifestation of deeper mental illness. Their reports were inconclusive, suggesting that Davies was in a state of “detached defiance.” [ 47 ]

The public reaction was divided. Some commentators, particularly those who had followed the case closely, argued that the sentence was too lenient given the gravity of the robbery and the hostage situation. Others, especially those in the African‑American community, saw the sentence as a vindication of their struggle against systemic oppression. The media coverage was rife with commentary on the “mission for the people” that Davies had written to his brother, a note that had become a rallying cry for a segment of the populace. The note, which had been found in his pocket, was quoted extensively in newspapers and television broadcasts. [ 48 ]

The prison authorities, wary of potential unrest, increased security measures. The three men were transferred to a maximum‑security wing, where they were monitored closely. The prison warden, Mr. Thomas Whitaker, issued a statement that read, “The safety of our staff and the inmates is paramount. We will continue to uphold the law and the dignity of the institution.” [ 49 ]

In the interim, the other accomplices, Lillo Termine, had already faced a plea deal. He was sentenced to 12 years, a reduction from the original 20 years proposed by the prosecution. The judge acknowledged that his cooperation had been instrumental in the case.
