On the third morning of the siege, the police tightened their perimeter, sealing every exit and cutting off all communications to the outside world. Inside, the men—Davies, Dick, and their small cadre—were increasingly restless. The hostages, now four, were exhausted, their food supplies dwindling, and their morale slipping. The police, meanwhile, had brought in a tactical unit trained in hostage rescue, but the decision was clear: they would wait for a surrender that would preserve lives.

At 02:15 on the fourth day, a sudden burst of gunfire echoed through the building. A lone shot struck the ceiling, shattering a window and sending a spray of glass into the room. The men inside reacted with a mix of fear and resolve. The police, observing from a safe distance, began a psychological operation, broadcasting recorded messages from the Home Secretary and offering an unconditional release if the captors surrendered peacefully. The broadcast, delivered through the radio that had been granted earlier, carried a plea from the Home Secretary, Sir William Whitelaw, urging the men to "end this violence and return to the law."

Despite the broadcast, the men held firm. Their leader, Davies, delivered a short, guttural speech, echoing the slogans of the liberation movements that had inspired them. He demanded that the police hand over a "fair trial" and that the police "stop the oppression." The police, however, were not willing to negotiate on those terms. They had been instructed by the Home Office to preserve the lives of the hostages at all costs, and any concession could be seen as a sign of weakness.

On the fifth day, a host of events converged. The police, having exhausted all other options, decided to deploy a small team of snipers in the roof corners. The team, trained in urban warfare, had the task of forcing a surrender without a direct assault. At 04:20, a single bullet struck the wall of the room, causing a collapse of the ceiling that exposed a window. The men inside were forced to retreat into a cramped space, and the police used the opening to insert a negotiator, a former civil servant who had worked in crisis management for the Home Office. The negotiator, speaking in a calm, measured tone, offered a compromise: the men could leave with the promise that their names would not be used in any criminal proceeding, and they would be allowed to "live in exile."

The men, after a tense negotiation that lasted nearly an hour, agreed to the terms. The police, relieved, escorted them out of the building.
