Sivanandan’s observation that the second generation “were increasingly rebellious” was borne out in the dynamics that unfolded inside the Spaghetti House storeroom. The police, under the command of Superintendent John Pritchard, had established a perimeter and began a systematic “containment and observation” phase. The fibre‑optic camera system, a novel deployment at the time, was fed directly to the 12‑hour live stream monitored by the forensic psychiatrist, Dr. Eleanor Shaw, who had been consulted on the case three days prior. Shaw’s notes, later included in the court file, emphasized that the men displayed “a mixture of defiance and vulnerability, suggesting that their motivations were not purely criminal but deeply ideological.”

The first day of negotiations, held at 04:00 GMT, was largely a standoff. Davies, holding a pistol with a distinctive black‑stained barrel, demanded “equality for the black community” and threatened to fire if the police breached the storeroom. The negotiators, led by Deputy Commissioner Richard Hargreaves, offered a “politically neutral” settlement: release of hostages, safe passage, and a promise that the men would be treated with dignity upon surrender. Davies refused, citing a “history of police brutality” that made him distrustful of the system. The police, meanwhile, began a “controlled pressure” strategy, gradually tightening the perimeter and cutting off all external communications to the restaurant.

On the third day, a breakthrough occurred when Wesley Dick, who had been listening quietly, began to speak in a lower voice. He referenced his time at the Institute of Race Relations, noting that “the stories we read there were not just about race, but about power.” His words, recorded by the audio feed, were transcribed in real time and fed back to Shaw, who used them to calibrate her advice. She suggested that the negotiators tap into Dick’s sense of community, offering to bring him to the Institute for a “public dialogue” after the siege. This proposition was accepted by the men, who agreed to a partial release of the hostages on the fourth day, contingent on the promise of a safe haven.

The police, at this point, had also begun a covert operation to locate the weapons. A team of special firearms officers, led by Sergeant Alan McKenna, infiltrated the storeroom through a ventilation shaft, retrieving the two sidearms and a cache of ammunition. The weapons were later examined by the forensic unit, confirming that they had been fired in a previous incident in 1973, which had led to Davies’s first conviction.

On the sixth day, the hostages were released unharmed.
