The third day of the standoff brought a new development that surprised the negotiators. A small group of supporters, some of whom had been waiting outside the police perimeter, managed to slip a note into the back of the door, a crude message that read, “We have food and water. We will not harm you.” The note was seized by a police officer who, after a quick scan, found it contained a single line of text and a faint signature that matched a known associate of Wesley Dick. This prompted the police to open a new line of communication, offering the men a chance to speak directly to a senior officer without the presence of the outside support group. The offer was accepted, and a telephone line was set up in a makeshift booth inside the building, with the line monitored by a team of negotiators and a psychologist.

In the ensuing conversation, the men—Davies, Dick, and the third accomplice, a young man named Jamal—expressed a clear desire to end the siege peacefully. They reiterated their demands, but this time they added a new condition: the release of a group of political prisoners who had been detained on charges that they claimed were politically motivated. The police, meanwhile, remained firm that the situation was a criminal act and that any demands for political prisoners were outside the scope of the negotiations. The tension escalated when one of the hostages, a young woman named Linda, began to cry and begged for her life. Her emotional appeal caused the negotiators to pause, and they decided to extend a temporary truce, allowing the hostages to receive fresh water and a brief moment of respite.

The truce lasted only a few minutes. During that time, a sudden burst of gunfire erupted from the building. The police responded with a barrage of warning shots, and the men inside fired back, hitting the roof of a nearby police vehicle. The incident marked the first time that the police had used live ammunition during the siege, and it was widely reported that the police had been forced to retreat to a safer position. The situation had escalated from a simple armed robbery to a full-scale firefight, and the police were forced to call in reinforcements from the Special Operations Group.

The Special Operations Group, led by a seasoned officer named Captain Jameson, arrived with armored vehicles and tactical gear. The group set up a perimeter around the building and began a careful approach, using smoke grenades to obscure the building from the men inside. The men, on the other hand, had set up a series of barricades inside the building, using furniture and makeshift weapons to defend themselves.
