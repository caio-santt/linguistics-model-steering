She sat, the window fogged with breath, and watched the lake ripple, the sky a pale wash, and her mind drifted, drifting, drifting, a river of thoughts that twisted, twisted, twisted, as if she could not decide whether to keep the image of him in mind or let it dissolve into the mist that hovered over the water. He, she, it, they all swirled in her head, a choir of pronouns that sang without words. She wondered if the name Ernest, the syllables that had sounded like a bell, could ever feel like home, like a word that belonged to her, not to a man who had arrived in a car with a stranger's laughter echoing behind him. She remembered the wedding march, the pigeons, the rice, the fox terrier, and how she had felt a strange knot tighten in her chest, a knot that did not loosen, no matter how many times she stared at the scene. He was there, a man with a straight nose, blue eyes, a firm mouth that seemed to hold secrets, and yet she could see him as a rabbit, a creature that hopped, that flicked its nose, that was small and timid, and she laughed. He laughed, too, and the laughter bubbled, bubbled, bubbled, and she felt the sound seep into her bones, into the space between her ribs, into the hollow where the day had once lived. She wondered if the laughter was a key, a key that could unlock the door to a new life, or if it was a mirror that reflected the same old patterns, the same old questions that had followed her since she had stepped into the car that day. The question hung, heavy, heavy, heavy, like a stone that could not be lifted. She could not remember if she had ever felt a sense of belonging, a sense that she could stand beside him, that she could share a room, a breakfast, a morning that was not just a repetition of the same rituals. The name Ernest, the name that had been spoken in a crowded hall, the name that had been spoken again in a quiet hotel, had she ever known what it meant? She wondered if she could imagine a different name, a name that would feel like a thread that connected her to something deeper, something that was not a borrowed identity. He, she, it, they all moved in her thoughts, moving, moving, moving, and she felt the pulse of her own heart, a rhythm that matched the rhythm of his breath, a rhythm that was a rhythm of life.
