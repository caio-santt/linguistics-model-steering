Safe , safe , safe , the pulse of the house steadied, as if the walls themselves exhaled, a breath of old dust and memory, a sigh that curled through the rafters, through the cracks of the floorboards, through the gaps where light had once slipped in. He, she, I, we all became echoes, voices that drifted, that hovered, that lingered, that hovered again, again, in the dimness that pressed against the corners of the room, pressed against the corners of the mind. The pulse, that pulse, that pulse, it hummed, it hummed, it hummed, a low, slow rhythm that matched the beating of our own hearts, matched the beating of the beating of the heart that had once, once, once, been our own. 

The wind, that wind, that wind, whispered through the cracks, whispered through the cracks, whispered through the cracks of the panes, through the panes that were glass, that were glass, that were glass, that were glass, that were glass, that were glass, that were glass, that were glass, that were glass. The wind carried a scent, a scent of pine, of damp earth, of the damp earth, of the damp earth, of the damp earth, of the damp earth, of the damp earth, of the damp earth, of the damp earth, that had once been there, that had once been there, that had once been there, that had once been there.
