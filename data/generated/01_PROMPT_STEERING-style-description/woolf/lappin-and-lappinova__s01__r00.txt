Yes , said Ernest , looking at her as she had looked, as though the eyes had become a mirror that reflected back the very pulse of his own heart, and the tremor that ran through his fingers was not a tremor at all but a quiet drumbeat that kept time with the world around them. She, too, felt the same beat, a rhythm that came from the very marrow of her bones, a rhythm that seemed to say that nothing was truly as it first appeared, that every name was a mask and every mask a revelation. She asked, her voice soft and steady, as if the words were a prayer that could bend the wind, “What did the King do tonight?”

Ernest smiled, the smile being a thin line that flickered like a candle flame in the dark, “He went into the wood,” he whispered, the words folding into the silence that surrounded them, “and he found a path that had never been walked before.” He lifted his hand, a hand that had known the weight of a pen, the weight of a decision, the weight of a life, and he placed it on her shoulder, a gesture that was a bridge between two souls. She felt the warmth of his skin against her own, a warmth that was not a warmth but a promise, a promise that the night would be filled with stories that would echo in their minds long after the stars had faded.

They walked, walking through a forest that was a living thing, breathing, moving, and the trees were like old friends that whispered to them, “We have been waiting for you, King Lappin.” He, who had never been a king in the sense that a king was a ruler, was a king in the sense that he had a crown of experience, a crown that was not made of gold but of memory, memory that was a river that ran through his thoughts. He walked, and his footsteps were a rhythm that matched the rhythm of her breath, and the rhythm of her breath was a rhythm that matched the rhythm of the wind that rustled the leaves.

The night was dark, dark as a well, a well that had no bottom, and yet they felt safe, safe because they had each other, and the other was a mirror that reflected back their own fears and hopes. They sat, sat on a log that was a throne, and the log was a throne that had seen many kings, many queens, many lovers, many lovers who had left their marks on the wood.
