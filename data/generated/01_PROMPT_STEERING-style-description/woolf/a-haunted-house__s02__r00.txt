Safe, safe, safe, the pulse of the house beat, and I felt it pulse in my own chest, a rhythm that matched the beat of my breath, my thoughts, my pulse, my pulse. I heard it, heard it, heard it, and it told me that the door was not a door, but a threshold, a breath, a pause. I breathed, I breathed, I breathed, and the breath became the wind that blew, blew, blew through the hall, through the hall, through the hall.

I walked, I walked, I walked, and I felt the floor beneath me, the floor beneath me, the floor beneath me, a floor that was not a floor but a memory, a memory that held my name, my name, my name. I saw the light, I saw the light, I saw the light, flicker, flicker, flicker, and it flickered, flickered, flickered, like a candle that was not a candle but a promise. I thought, I thought, I thought, that the promise was not a promise but a whisper, a whisper that whispered, whispered, whispered, about a past that was not a past but a present.

The ghostly couple moved, the ghostly couple moved, the ghostly couple moved, and I felt their weight, their weight, their weight, as if they were not weight but a presence, a presence that pressed, pressed, pressed, against my skin. I felt their presence, I felt their presence, I felt their presence, and I heard their voices, voices that were not voices but a song, a song that sang, sang, sang, about a love that was not love but a fire. I heard, I heard, I heard, and the fire burned, burned, burned, in my mind, in my mind, in my mind.

I opened the window, I opened the window, I opened the window, and I saw the night, the night, the night, a night that was not a night but a canvas, a canvas that painted, painted, painted, with colors that were not colors but feelings. I felt the colors, I felt the colors, I felt the colors, and I felt that the feelings were not feelings but a tide, a tide that pulled, pulled, pulled, my thoughts into the sea. I felt, I felt, I felt, and the sea rose, rose, rose, over my head, over my head, over my head.
