In the hush of that night, I felt the house breathe, a breath that seemed to belong to the walls themselves, and I wondered, was it a sigh or a whisper? I could hear my own heartbeat echoing against the rafters, a rhythm that matched the thrum of the old threshing machine, and I felt it pull me inward, toward the unseen. I had come, I had thought, to find a truth that was not written in any book, but written in the cracks of the floorboards, and I found myself looking for the truth in the silence that surrounded me. I saw the pigeons still, their bubbles of sound rising, and I felt that sound like a question, a question that asked, what am I to do? I saw the apples in the loft, their skins still bright, and I wondered if they were a promise, a promise that I could not grasp. I turned, I turned again, and I turned to the garden, the garden that held the same old trees, and I saw the book slip, slip into the grass, and I felt that slip like a memory slipping away. I saw the drawing room, and I saw the window panes, and I saw the apples reflected, and I saw the roses reflected, and I saw the leaves, and I saw the glass, and I felt the glass like a veil, a veil that hid the truth. I saw the apple turn its yellow side, and I felt the turn like a secret, a secret that was being kept. I saw the door open, and I saw the light spread, and I felt the light like a promise that was fading. I felt the shadow of a thrush cross the carpet, and I felt the silence deep, and I felt the pigeon draw its bubble, and I felt the pulse of the house beat softly. I heard the words, "Safe, safe, safe," and I felt the pulse stop, and I felt the treasure buried, and I felt the room, and I felt the pulse stop short. I felt the question, "Was that the buried treasure?" and I felt the light fade, and I felt the garden, and I felt the trees spin darkness, and I felt the beam of sun wander. I felt the beam I sought, and I felt it burn behind the glass, and I felt death as glass, death as between us, and I felt the woman, and I felt the years, and I felt the house, and I felt the windows sealed, and I felt the darkness.
