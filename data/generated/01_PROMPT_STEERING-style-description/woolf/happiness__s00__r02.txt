Was it balancing one thing against another, she asked? Was it, as she felt, a kind of invisible scale that tipped under the weight of her own thoughts, that she had to set aside to keep the world from tumbling? He paused, his gaze drifting to the thin line of the window, where light slid like a shy fish through the glass, and he answered in a voice that seemed to echo from the very marrow of his bones.

It was not the scale, nor the balance, but the feeling that, when she spoke of her own smallness, he could hear a faint hum in the air, a hum that matched the rhythm of his own pulse. He spoke slowly, each word a step on a narrow path, and she listened, her mind racing to catch the cadence of his breath.

He described the way his own life had been a series of tiny, silent moments, each one a petal that fell in its own time, and she realized that she had never allowed herself to feel such quietness. She had always been a woman who rushed, who pushed, who demanded the world to move at her pace, and now she felt the possibility of a pause, of a breath that could be shared.

She imagined herself as a river, winding through fields, carrying stones and leaves, and he, as a stone in that river, feeling the current and the pressure of the water against his sides. He told her that the river never stopped, that it only changed its speed, its depth, its direction. She smiled, a small, fragile smile that seemed to grow brighter as she considered the idea that she could be a stone that could still move, that could still be part of the flow.

He spoke of his own longing for lobster, a dream that had been locked away in a chest of wishes, and she laughed, the sound bright and sharp, and she saw in his laughter a mirror of her own hidden desires, desires that she had buried beneath the weight of her responsibilities. She felt the echo of his words, the echo that rang in her chest like a bell, and she thought that perhaps, if she let herself be the stone, she could feel the river in her own bones.

She asked him again, in a voice that trembled slightly, what it meant to be at one with the world. He answered with a smile that was not a smile but a gesture, a nod that said, I understand, I have felt it too.
