They sat, the fire low, the night thick, and their minds, like the smoke, curled, twisted, turned, and turned again, as if the air itself were a question, and the answer a sigh, and the answer a memory that slipped through, that slipped, that slipped.  
They spoke of Helen, of the smile, of the way she laughed, and they each, each, each, felt the same pull, that quiet tug that said, that she was here, that she was gone, that she was still in the corner of their thoughts, a place where words died.  
They wondered, wondered, wondered, about the whistle, that thin line of sound that came from the far, from the fields, from a train, from a siren, and they felt, they felt, they felt as if the sound were a hand, a hand that touched, touched, touched the edges of their minds, and left a trace.  
They remembered the dog, the pup, the small, the grinning, the one that had lived in the night, and they felt, felt, felt the way that one feels when a child, a child, a child, has slipped from the room, from the hand, from the heart, and the hand that had held it was now empty.  
They spoke of the farmer, of the snow, of the whips, of the basket, and they felt, felt, felt as if the basket were a chest, a chest that held a piece of the past, a piece of the past, a piece of the past that was a scrap of a dog, a scrap that was a memory.  
They listened, listened, listened, to the words, to the silence, to the wind, and they felt, felt, felt that the silence was a mirror, a mirror that reflected the way that the night, the night, the night, had swallowed, swallowed, swallowed all that had been, all that had been, all that had been.  
They thought, thought, thought, about the way that grief, grief, grief, can be a quiet, quiet, quiet river that runs through the mind, that runs through the mind, that runs through the mind, and they felt that the river was a path, a path that led, led, led to places they could not see.
