even as the light bent in the thin mist, he felt the weight of that unseen hand that had steadied him, as if the air itself had taken the shape of a friend, a silent voice that whispered, “stay.” He breathed, the breath a thin thread, a line that ran from the chest to the mind, a line that cut through the noise of the world, a line that seemed to carry him forward, forward into the maze of his own thoughts. He thought of her, of her words, of that strange dance of accusation and longing that had been set before him like a stage, a stage that he had never chosen, yet could not escape, could not ignore, could not relinquish. He remembered the way she had held his hand, the way her fingers had traced a pattern that felt like a map, a map of a path that he could not see but that seemed to lead somewhere, somewhere far beyond the garden gate, beyond the walls that had held him, beyond the walls that had held her. He felt the pull of that path, that pull that tugged at his chest, tugged at his heart, tugged at his mind, tugged at his very sense of self, a sense that was fragile, a sense that was strong, a sense that was both. He wondered if the sense was a mask, a mask that hid the truth, the truth that he had never told her, the truth that he had kept locked inside, inside a chest that he could not open, could not open, could not open. He wondered if the truth was a fire, a fire that burned inside him, inside her, inside both, inside the world that had been built around them, around the house, around the garden, around the lake, around the river, around the place where they had first met. He remembered that day, that day when he had first seen her, the day when he had felt the warmth of her smile, the warmth that had seeped into his bones, into his mind, into his heart, into his soul. He felt the warmth of that day, the warmth that had been there for a moment, a moment that seemed to last forever, forever, forever. He thought of the way he had left, the way he had left the world behind, the way he had left her behind, the way he had left the world, the way he had left the world. He wondered if he would ever find a way back, a way back to the place where he had been, where he had been, where he had been, where he had been, where he had been.
