She paused, her gaze drifting to the faint flicker of candlelight that danced upon the wall, and in that wavering glow she felt a pulse, a thrum that seemed to echo the very beat of her own heart, a beat that she could almost hear in the quiet hush that fell over the room as the others settled into their chairs. She could not help but wonder, she could not help but feel that the world she had built, the world that lay beneath the surface of the quiet manor, was a fragile thing, a thing that could be broken by a single thought, by a single breath that she might let slip. She felt, she felt, that she was a thread in a tapestry that was woven by many hands, but she was also a thread that could be pulled, that could be tugged, that could be unraveled if she let it.

He, she, they, it, each pronoun seemed to swirl in the air, a silent choir that sang of their shared history, of their shared secret, of the fact that they were bound together by more than just a marriage, but by a pact that had been forged in the quiet depths of their minds. She felt, she felt, that the pact was a weight, a weight that she carried in her chest, a weight that she could not shake, no matter how hard she tried. She felt, she felt, that the weight was a promise, a promise that she had made to herself, to him, to the world that existed beyond the walls of the manor, a world that she had once imagined as a place of endless fields and endless nights, a world that she had now seen as a place of darkness and light.

The night was still, the air was cool, and the quiet was broken only by the soft murmur of the fireplace, the crackle of the fire that seemed to speak in a language she could understand. She felt, she felt, that the fire was a reminder, a reminder that she was alive, that she was breathing, that she was part of something larger than herself. She felt, she felt, that the fire was a sign, a sign that she could not be alone, that she could not be forgotten, that she could not be lost.

She thought of the golden-wedding party, of the laughter that had filled the room, of the way the faces had shone with joy, and she felt, she felt, that she could not have imagined a better moment.
