He remembered that the morning had come with a thin, pale letter, and he felt that the thinness was not the paper but the breath of her voice, and he felt the breath in his chest, and he felt the chest in his mind, and he felt the mind in the street, and he felt the street in the train, and he felt the train in the sky, and he felt the sky in his eyes, and he felt the eyes in the dark, and he felt the dark in his thoughts, and he felt the thoughts in the silence that followed.  

He wondered why the night had held him still, and he wondered why she had left the house, and he wondered why the house had not been enough, and he wondered why the enough had not been the same, and he wondered why the same had not been a thing, and he wondered why a thing had not been her, and he wondered why her had not been the one who could have saved the day, and he wondered why the day had not been a moment, and he wondered why a moment had not been a breath, and he wondered why a breath had not been the breath of the dog, and he wondered why the dog had not been the one who could have carried the letter, and he wondered why the letter had not been the one that could have carried him.
