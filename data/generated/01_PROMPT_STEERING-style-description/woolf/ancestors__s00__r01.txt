She paused, her breath a quiet drum against the glass, and felt the room pulse, a slow, steady thrum that seemed to echo the beating of a heart that was not her own. She turned her gaze to Jack, who stood by the window, his shoulders hunched, his eyes flickering over the street like a mind that had learned to read between the lines of traffic. She felt the weight of that gaze, the pull of his silence, and she knew, as she had known since childhood, that his silence was not emptiness but a vast, uncharted sea that she could only dip a finger into.

She thought, her mind a maze of whorls and loops, of thoughts that turned back upon themselves, and she wondered, as she had always wondered, whether the sea had ever been calm, whether the waves had ever been gentle. She remembered her father, a man of simple, dignified ways, who had taught her to see the quiet in the storm, the order in the chaos. He had never spoken of the world beyond the borders of their little town, but she could feel the pull of the world in his eyes, a pull that tugged at her own heart.

She turned her attention again to the window, to the street below, to the people who moved through the lanes, each a story, each a whisper. She felt the urge to speak, to explain, to bridge the gulf between her world and his, to let him know that she was not a stranger to the storms, that she had weathered them, that she had learned to find calm in the most turbulent of seas. She spoke softly, as if the words themselves were fragile, as if each syllable could shatter the fragile glass that separated them.

"Jack," she said, her voice a tremor of hope, "do you remember the day we walked by the river, the way the water glowed in the afternoon sun? I remember the way you laughed, the way your eyes crinkled, the way you looked at me, as if you were seeing me for the first time. That was a day, a day that I have kept in my mind like a secret, a secret that I have never shared with anyone, not even with you."

She paused, feeling the words hang in the air, as if they were a fragile thing, and she felt the world around her shift, as if the room itself were breathing.
