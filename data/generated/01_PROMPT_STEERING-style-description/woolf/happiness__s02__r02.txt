Why then did he linger, his eyes still tracking the soft curve of the horizon, that stretch where light seemed to pause, that breath of air that carried the scent of the river, that memory of the day before, that feeling that had crept in, unbidden, like a tide? He thought, as he did, that perhaps the question was not what had come, but what had gone, what had slipped, what had been left behind, what had been left to him, and that the answer lay in the quiet that followed the storm, that the silence that followed the noise, that the stillness that followed the motion. He felt, he felt that the moment was a doorway, a threshold, a gate that opened to a space where he could be, without any of the weight, without any of the expectations, without any of the names. He knew that he had to keep moving, that he had to keep walking, that he had to keep feeling the ground under his feet, that he had to keep hearing the wind in the leaves, that he had to keep looking at the sky, that he had to keep seeing the shape of the clouds, that he had to keep hearing the birds, that he had to keep feeling the pulse of the earth. He could not let the wolves pull him, could not let the wolves pull his thoughts, could not let the wolves pull his heart, could not let the wolves pull his mind, could not let the wolves pull his sense of self. He could not let the wolves pull his memory, could not let the wolves pull his longing, could not let the wolves pull his fear, could not let the wolves pull his doubt. He felt that the wolves were only a part of him, that they were a part of the story, that they were a part of the past, that they were a part of the present, that they were a part of the future. He understood that the wolves were a symbol, a metaphor, a sign, a warning, a lesson, a truth. He understood that the wolves were a part of the world, that the world was a part of the world, that the world was a part of the world. He felt that the world was a part of him, that he was a part of the world, that he was a part of the world, that he was a part of the world, that he was a part of the world, that he was a part of the world.
