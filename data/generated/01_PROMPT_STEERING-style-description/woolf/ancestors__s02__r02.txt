She sat still, the air thick with the scent of cedar and old paper, and her mind wandered, a river of thought, turning, looping, circling back to that same starlit garden, that same cedar, that same cedar, that same memory, that same feeling of being seen. It was she who felt the weight, the pull of those unseen hands, the echo of those quiet voices that had once whispered, that had once hummed, that had once sang. She could hear them, faint, in the rustle of leaves, in the creak of the old pump, in the soft sigh of the wind, and she wondered, why did the past feel so alive, so close, so tender? She wondered, why did the past feel so heavy, so bright, so aching? It was she who remembered, she who remembered the way her father had smiled, the way he had folded his hands, the way he had said, "It is you who are the light," and she remembered the way his eyes had shone, the way his eyes had glowed, the way his eyes had reflected the night.

She thought of the girl in the cotton frock, the girl with the dark wild eyes, the girl who had been so pure, so good, so gifted, who had been the hope, the promise, the future. She thought of that girl who had been the child, the child who had been the dream, the child who had been the hope. She thought of the way the world had seemed, the way the world had been, the way the world had changed, and she wondered, what had she lost? What had she gained? She thought of the way the garden had been, the way the garden had grown, the way the garden had wilted, and she wondered, why did the garden still feel like home, like a safe harbor, like a place where she could rest, where she could breathe, where she could be, where she could be herself?

She felt the tears come, soft, slow, like a river, like a tide, like a flood, and she let them fall, letting them wash away the dust of the day, the dust of the years, the dust of the past, and she let them soak into the soil, into the roots, into the heart.
