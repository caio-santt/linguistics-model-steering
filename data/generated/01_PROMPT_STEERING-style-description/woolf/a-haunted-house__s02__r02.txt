I keep walking, I keep thinking, I keep hearing the pulse of the house, it pulses like a heart that never sleeps, it pulses like a drum that beats with memory, it pulses with the echo of footsteps that never come. I feel the air, I feel the chill, I feel the weight of the silence that hangs heavy, that hangs like a curtain, that hangs like a veil over the rooms. I hear the wind, I hear the wind that whispers, it whispers like a lover, it whispers like a ghost, it whispers like a promise that has been broken. I think that the treasure is not gold, I think that the treasure is a memory, I think that the treasure is a secret that the house keeps, a secret that the house keeps in its bones. I know that the door is locked, I know that the door is locked with a key that I cannot find, I know that the key is hidden in the floor, I know that the floor is covered with dust, dust that covers the truth. I feel the pulse, I feel the pulse that says safe, safe, safe, safe, safe, safe, safe, safe. I feel that the pulse is a lullaby, a lullaby that soothes the soul, a lullaby that soothes the mind, a lullaby that soothes the heart. I see the shadows, I see the shadows that move like waves, waves that crash against the walls, waves that crash against the windows. I see the ghostly couple, I see the ghostly couple that sits in the corner, that sits in the corner with a candle, that sits in the corner with a smile, that sits in the corner with a sigh.
