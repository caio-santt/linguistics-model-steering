he paused, eyes drifting toward the thin line where the sky met the green, his mind looping like a reel caught in a storm of thought, his breath a quiet drum in the hush that followed. she, with her hands clasped tight, watched him, a silent witness to the tremor that seemed to shake his core, a tremor that made his pulse skip, his heart beat a question in the dark.

he, with a sigh that was almost a confession, said, “It is not the illness that matters, nor the joke that lies in its name. It is the space between what is and what could be that keeps me moving, keeps me alive.” his voice, a thin thread, slipped through the air, his words hanging like a weightless feather.

she, her eyes a mirror of his own, asked, “So, you are balancing, then, the thing you fear with the thing you love, are you?” her voice, a whisper, a breath, a pulse, a single beat that felt like a drum in his chest. she, with a tilt of her head, added, “And what if the balance is lost? What if the thing you love turns into the thing you fear?”

he, with a laugh that was almost a sob, answered, “I am not sure, but I can feel it, can feel it in the bones of my mind, can feel it in the space between my thoughts.” he, with a gesture, a slight tilt of his head, added, “It is like the river, the stream, the trout, the flag, the breeze. All of them move, all of them shift, all of them are part of the same current, the same flow, the same breath.” he, with a hand that was almost a question, said, “And you, do you feel it, too?”

she, with a nod that was almost a confession, said, “I feel it. I feel it in the way my heart beats, in the way my breath moves, in the way my mind moves. I feel it in the way I walk, in the way I stand, in the way I sit.” she, with a smile that was almost a tear, added, “I feel it in the way I love, in the way I hate, in the way I fear.”

he, with a laugh that was almost a cry, said, “I am not sure if I can keep this balance, if I can keep this love, if I can keep this fear. I am not sure if I can keep this.”
