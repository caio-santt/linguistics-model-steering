and each of them, in that quiet way that only people who have shared a meal in a foreign hotel can share, began to wonder how long such happiness could stay, how long the laughter could stay, how long the rabbit‑nose twitches could stay. She, she, she, she, she—her mind a river, her mind a maze, her mind a field of small stones that she, she, she, she, she, she could not walk over without feeling the weight of each stone, could not turn away from the weight, could not turn away from the feeling that she, she, she, she, she, she was being watched, could not turn away from the feeling that she, she, she, she, she, she was being heard, could not turn away from the feeling that she, she, she, she, she, she was being judged, could not turn away from the feeling that she, she, she, she, she, she was being loved, could not turn away from the feeling that she, she, she, she, she, she was being lost. The car had left, the lake had glimmered, the mountains had stood silent, the sky had turned pale, the wind had whispered, the wind had breathed, the wind had breathed, the wind had breathed. He, he, he, he, he, he had gone to breakfast, he, he, he, he, he, he had gone to the kitchen, he, he, he, he, he, he had gone to the table, he, he, he, he, he, he had gone to the counter, he, he, he, he, he, he had gone to the counter, he, he, he, he, he, he had gone to the counter, he, he, he, he, he, he had gone to the counter. The question that swirled in her mind was not a question that could be answered, not a question that could be solved, not a question that could be measured, not a question that could be told, not a question that could be answered, not a question that could be answered, not a question that could be answered. It was a question that lived, it lived, it lived, it lived, it lived, it lived, it lived, it lived, it lived, it lived, it lived, it lived, it lived, it lived.
