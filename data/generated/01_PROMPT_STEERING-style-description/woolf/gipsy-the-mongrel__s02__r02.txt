She remembered, and she felt the pulse of the street as it swelled, and she let it swell in her mind, and she felt the echo of that dog’s bark, and she felt it echo in her chest, and she felt it echo in the walls of her house, and she felt it echo in the way the wind pressed against the windows, and she felt it echo in the way the children’s laughter rang through the alley, and she felt it echo in the way the old shopkeeper’s hands shook as he counted coins, and she felt it echo in the way the rain kissed the cobblestones, and she felt it echo in the way the night swallowed the light. She thought of the way she had once been frightened of that small creature, and she thought of the way she had once seen him as a threat, and she thought of the way she had once seen him as a friend, and she thought of the way she had once felt the weight of his presence, and she thought of the way she had once felt the weight of her own fear, and she thought of the way she had once felt the weight of the world, and she thought of the way she had once felt the weight of being alone, and she thought of the way she had once felt the weight of being loved, and she thought of the way she had once felt the weight of being remembered, and she thought of the way she had once felt the weight of the memory that was now a part of her, and she thought of the way she had once felt the weight of that memory.

She spoke, and she spoke to herself, and she spoke to the silence that lay between the words, and she spoke to the rhythm of her own breathing, and she spoke to the rhythm of the street, and she spoke to the rhythm of the dog’s tail, and she spoke to the rhythm of the wind, and she spoke to the rhythm of the heart. She told herself that she could not let that dog’s memory be a curse, and she told herself that she could not let it be a blessing, and she told herself that she could not let it be a shadow, and she told herself that she could not let it be a light. She told herself that she could not let it be a story, and she told herself that she could not let it be a myth, and she told herself that she could not let it be a dream, and she told herself that she could not let it be a nightmare.
