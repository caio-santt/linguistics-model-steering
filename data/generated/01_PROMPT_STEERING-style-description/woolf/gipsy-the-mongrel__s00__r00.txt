The night settled deeper, and the fire cracked like thoughts in a mind that had long since forgotten how to rest. They sat, the Bridgers and the Bagots, their faces lit by the glow, and the silence that followed felt like a breath held too long. He, the eldest of the Bagots, could not help but feel the weight of a question that had been left unsaid, a question that had been asked in the form of a whisper, a question that lingered between them all. She, the one whose smile had been remembered, was gone, and yet her memory clung to each of them like a stubborn thread that refused to unravel. He, the younger, felt the pull of that thread, felt it tug at his chest, felt it drag him into a place where the past was not simply a memory but a living thing that could be touched, felt, and understood.

They spoke of her smile, of how it had seemed to light up a room, of how it had been the kind of smile that made a man feel safe, that made a woman feel that she was enough. They spoke of how it had been a smile that had been remembered, remembered even after the fact, remembered as a sign of something that had once been, something that had been real, something that had been loved. She, the girl who had vanished, had left behind a void that was not empty, but full of echoes, echoes that were heard in the wind that blew across the fields, echoes that were heard in the rustle of the trees, echoes that were heard in the way the fire burned, burning in a way that seemed to be a reflection of her own inner fire.

They remembered how she had been, how she had been kind, how she had been gentle, how she had been bright. They remembered how she had been, how she had been a light that shone even in the darkest of nights, how she had been a light that had been a beacon for those who were lost. They remembered how she had been, how she had been a presence that had been felt, felt as a warmth that had been felt in their bones, felt as a comfort that had been felt in their hearts. They remembered how she had been, how she had been a presence that had been there, there in the way that the wind carried the scent of rain, that carried the scent of the earth, that carried the scent of a memory that had been alive.

He, the eldest, thought of the way she had been, how she had been a part of him, part of everyone.
