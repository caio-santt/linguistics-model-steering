Was it balancing one thing against another, she asked? Was it the pull of the past that kept her tied to the soil, the pull of the future that tugged at her, the pull of the present that weighed her down with its ordinary weight? She looked at him, at the man who seemed to carry the world in his palms, and she wondered, wondered in that way that makes the mind spin, that makes the heart tremble, that makes the body feel like it is caught in a net of its own making. He, she, it, them, each pronoun seemed to float like a feather, each feather a thought, each thought a thread that wove through the space between them, the space that held the memory of the rose and the petal and the thread that fell, fell again, fell again, falling like a sigh.

He thought of his own thread, of the thread that had slipped from his trousers, of the thread that had become a river in his mind, a river that ran through him, through his bones, through his breath, through his thoughts, and through the very air that he inhaled. He thought that the thread was a symbol, a symbol of the way that life can be both simple and complex, simple like a thread, complex like a knot that is not seen but felt. He thought that the knot was his own mind, his own heart, his own past, his own future, his own present, all tangled together in a way that made sense only when he let it, when he let the thread fall, when he let the petal fall, when he let the rose bloom.

She thought of her own thread, of the thread that had been woven into her days, of the thread that had been cut by the managers, by the appointments that never came, by the silence that spoke louder than words. She thought that the thread was her life, her life that was not a thread but a web, a web that she could not see, a web that she could not feel, a web that she could feel only when she was near the river of the rose, near the petal that fell, near the thread that slipped. She thought that she was a woman who had no connection to the stage, no connection to the people that mattered, no connection to the past, no connection to the future. She thought that she was a woman who had to live with the present, with the thread that fell, with the petal that fell, with the rose that bloomed.
