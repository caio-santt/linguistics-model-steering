She turned her gaze again, as if the room itself were a mirror that could not hold her reflection, and she felt the weight of the light that slipped through the window, thin, cold, and she wondered what it meant to be caught between that and the shadows that clung to the corners. She heard the faint murmur of the street, a distant thrum, and she thought of the laughter that had once floated in the garden, and she felt a tremor in her chest, a small, aching thing that seemed to know, though it was not a thing, that it was her. She remembered her mother’s hands, her mother’s fingers, her mother’s touch, and she felt that the touch was a memory that could not be untied. She had seen the flowers in the vase, and she saw the petals, the soft, broken edges, and she felt the same pity that had once filled her heart when she was a child, and she felt that pity was a kind of love that did not need to be spoken, but that was spoken in the way she breathed.

She walked slowly, her feet moving without sound, and she listened to the quiet that lay beneath the chatter, the quiet that lay beneath the noise of London, and she felt that quiet was a place where she could be alone with her thoughts, and she felt that she could not be alone with herself, because she was a part of her own story, a story that was still being written. She felt the thread of her own narrative, a thread that ran through her days, through her nights, through the moments when she had no one to talk to, and she felt that thread was her own. She thought of the starlit garden that had once been there, and she thought of the trees that had stood tall, and she thought of the old man in his white coat, and she felt that those were the only ones who truly knew her, and she felt that the present was a stranger, a stranger that she could not trust.

She looked at the window, and she saw the city, the city that seemed to move like a living thing, and she felt that she was a small part of it, a part that could be forgotten, but she did not want to be forgotten. She thought of the children playing, and she felt the joy in their laughter, and she felt that joy was a light that could not be dimmed, no matter how dark the day.
