and then sitting up in bed in the hush of her own thoughts, she found herself turning toward the window, the glass thin as a sigh, and watching the street below as if it were a stage on which the city played out its own play. She could hear, faintly, the murmur of voices, the clatter of cups, the distant laugh of a child, and she wondered, in that moment, whether those sounds were real or simply echoes of her own mind, a trick of the mind that made her feel as though she were listening to the world through a veil of her own making. She felt the weight of the day settle upon her shoulders, a weight that was not of iron but of memory, and she could not help but think that memory was a kind of chain, a chain that bound her to places and people that were long gone, yet still present in her heart, and that she could not, for a moment, release.

She thought of her mother again, and she imagined her mother’s hands, which had once pressed the petals of a violet into her palm, and she wondered if those hands would still be there, if she could feel their warmth, if she could feel their tenderness, if she could feel the gentle press of a hand on her cheek that had once comforted her in a storm. She could feel the scent of lavender that had once filled the air of the garden, and she could feel the taste of tea that had once been poured into her cup by her mother, and she could feel the ache of a heart that had known love and loss and that had learned to accept the quietness that follows. She could feel that ache, and she could feel that ache in her chest, as if it were a drum, a drum that beat in time with her pulse, and she could feel the beat, and she could feel the beat of a heart that had loved and that had grieved, and she could feel the beat of a heart that had lived in a world that had been both bright and bleak.
