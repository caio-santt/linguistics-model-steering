She sat, the chair creaking softly, and thought, “It is strange, how all this noise of London, how all this noise of life, can feel like a quiet hum, a hum that seems to keep going, like a heart that does not stop.” She felt the weight of her own breath, and she felt the weight of her own heart, and she felt the weight of the room, the weight of the walls, the weight of the air that had been there for years, and she felt that the air was still, still, and still, and she felt that the air was a kind of life that was not yet done. She thought about the way her father had spoken, and she thought about the way her mother had smiled, and she thought about the way the garden had smelled, and she thought about the way the sea had sounded. She did not think about the words, she did not think about the names, she thought about the way the world had seemed to her then, and she felt that the world had seemed to her then, and she felt that the world had seemed to her then, and she felt that the world had seemed to her then. She felt that she had been a girl, a girl who had listened, and she felt that she had been a girl who had listened, and she felt that she had been a girl who had listened, and she felt that she had been a girl who had listened, and she felt that she had been a girl who had listened.

She saw the shape of a man walking, a shape that seemed to be in a hurry, and she saw the shape of a man walking, and she saw the shape of a man walking, and she saw the shape of a man walking. She did not know that man, she did not know that man, and she did not know that man, and she did not know that man, and she did not know that man.
