She thought then, as the night fell soft and the kitchen lights dimmed, that the whole world of the Thorburns had become a stage, and each of them a player, with the same script, the same lines, the same pauses. She felt the weight of her own name, Lapinova, like a small stone in her pocket, and she wondered if the stone would ever leave her, or if it would simply stay, heavy, in the dark of her thoughts. She had heard the old men in the hall talk of the garden, of the rabbits, of the way the moon made the grass shine, and she felt, almost, as if she could see them in her mind, running, leaping, and hiding behind the hedges. She did not know, however, that the rabbits were not just animals, but people, or that she was a person among them, a queen, a leader, a protector, and that she was also a woman, a lover, a wife, and a child of a different world.

She turned to the table, where the silverware lay, and she saw, in the reflection, a face that was not hers, but a face that she had always known, the face of the one who had taken her in, the one who had given her a name, and she felt the pull of that name, the pull of the word Lapinova, and she heard the whisper of the wind through the curtains, a sound that seemed to say, “You are here, you are needed, you are not alone.” She thought of the night before, of the wedding, of the golden-wedding party, of the many Thorburns, of the sons, of the daughters, and she felt a tremor in her chest, a tremor that she could not explain, a tremor that she could not deny. She thought of the way the old woman had said, “We have no room for a hare in a dish,” and she thought of the way the boy had laughed, and she felt a strange mixture of joy and sorrow.

She felt the clock on the wall tick, and she imagined that the tick was a heartbeat, a pulse that was in sync with her own, a pulse that was also in sync with the rabbits, and she felt that pulse, that rhythm, that beat that ran through the forest, through the meadow, through the night, through her own veins. She felt that she could hear the rabbits, could hear them, and she heard them, and she heard them as a chorus, a choir, a choir that sang of freedom, of life, of the night.
