She looked, she thought, she felt, and she wondered whether the walls of the room were breathing or merely holding her breath, and whether she could feel the breath of the city beyond the glass, that breath that was heavy with the scent of coal and the faint perfume of rain on stone, and she wondered if the city itself was listening, listening to her whisper, listening to the way her fingers trembled on the edge of the chair, trembling like the leaves of a tree that had been struck by a storm, trembling because she could not stop the storm inside her, because she could not stop the thought that she was a thing that belonged to no one, that she was a thing that belonged to the memory of her father and to the memory of her mother, that she was a thing that belonged to a time that had long since slipped away, that she was a thing that belonged to a place that she had never seen, that she was a thing that belonged to a dream that she could not catch.

She felt the weight of the silence, the silence that was like a blanket, a blanket that covered the floor, covered the windows, covered her thoughts, and she wondered if the blanket was a good thing or a bad thing, if it was a good thing because it kept her warm, because it kept her safe, because it kept her from the cold wind that blew outside, or if it was a bad thing because it kept her from seeing the light that came through the glass, that light that was bright and harsh and bright enough to cut her into pieces, and she wondered whether she would cut herself, or whether she would let the light cut her into pieces, or whether she would let the light cut her into something new.

She thought of the old man she had seen in the street, the old man with the white hair, the old man with the white hair who had looked at her and said, "What do you want?" and she thought of the way she had answered, of the way she had answered with a smile that was small and quick and quick because she was not sure, because she was not sure that she could be brave, because she was not sure that she could be honest, because she was not sure that she could be true to herself, and she wondered whether she had answered truthfully, whether she had answered honestly, whether she had answered brave, whether she had answered true, whether she had answered all of them, whether she had answered none of them.
