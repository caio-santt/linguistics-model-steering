Yet the thing that kept him in that place was not the weight of the world, but the quiet that lay between his thoughts, the thin thread that tied him to her, the way he could feel her pulse in the hush of the night, the way it hummed against his chest, and he could not let it break, even as the world spun around him.  
He could not see how she, who had come to be his anchor, could also be the weight he carried, and he could not see how he, who had always been a man of action, could also be a man of hesitation, and he could not see how he, who had known the taste of sorrow, could also taste the sweetness of hope.  
And he, who had been a man of words, now spoke only to himself, and he, who had once spoken to her, now spoke to the empty air, and he, who had once known a name, now knew only a sound, and he, who had once known a face, now knew only a shape.  
She, who had been a flame, now was a shadow, and she, who had once been a promise, now was a question, and she, who had once been a love, now was a memory.  
He, who had once thought he could hold the world, now thought he could only hold a breath, and he, who had once thought he could hold a heart, now thought he could only hold a pulse.  
And he, who had once known the taste of anger, now tasted only the salt of tears, and he, who had once known the taste of joy, now tasted only the taste of regret.  
He could not tell himself that he was not the man he had been, and he could not tell himself that he was still the man he had become, and he could not tell himself that he was both.  
And he, who had once known the sound of her laugh, now heard only the echo of his own breath, and he, who had once known the sound of her voice, now heard only the wind.
