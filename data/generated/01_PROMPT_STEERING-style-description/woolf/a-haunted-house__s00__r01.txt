He left it, left her, went North, went East, and the wind whispered in the cracks, a thread of memory that pulled at the heart of the empty rooms. He, the one who had walked in with the light of a candle, now walked with a shadow, the shadow that was his own doubt, his own fear, and the fear that had followed him since the first night he had stepped beyond the threshold. She, the one who had held his hand, now held nothing but the echo of his steps, the echo that was the sound of the house breathing, the house breathing in silence.

It was not the door that opened, but the silence that opened first, the silence that was a door in its own right, a door that opened into the space between breath and thought. The house, the house that had been a keeper of secrets, now opened to the air that was the space where thoughts could roam. And the thought that roamed was the thought that wondered if the treasure was in the loft or in the heart, if the treasure was in the loft or in the heart.

They, the ones who had looked for the treasure, looked for the treasure in the loft, looked for the treasure in the loft, but the loft was a loft of dust, dust that was the dust of time, time that had folded the pages of the book, the book that had been the map, the map that was a map of the mind. The mind, the mind that had been the mind of the house, had a mind that was a mind of its own, a mind that had a mind of its own. The mind was a mind that had a mind of its own, a mind that was the mind of the house.

The garden, the garden that had been the garden of the house, was a garden of silence, silence that was the silence of the birds, the birds that had been the birds of the night. The night, the night that had been the night of the house, was a night that was a night of thought, thought that was a thought of the house, the house that was a house of memory. Memory, memory that was memory of the past, past that was past of the house, the house that was a house of the past.

The apple, the apple that had been the apple in the loft, was a apple that was a apple of the mind.
