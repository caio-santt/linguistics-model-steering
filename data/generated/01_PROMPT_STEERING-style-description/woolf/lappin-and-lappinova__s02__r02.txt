She felt that she was an only child and an orphan at that; a mere drop among all those Thorburns assembled in the great drawing‑room with the shiny satin wallpaper and the lustrous family portraits. She could not see how the glittering mirrors, the polished wood, the heavy drapes, the endless faces, could ever be her own, could ever belong to her, could ever hold her breath, could ever hold her silence. She heard their laughter, their gossip, their sudden sighs, and she wondered whether the laughter was for her or for her, whether the sighs were for her or for her, whether the silence was for her or for her. She wondered whether the world she had known, the one she had lived in, was a dream, a memory, a story, or a truth, whether the world she now saw was a mirror, a trap, a cage, or a sanctuary. She wondered whether the secret world, the one she had found, the one she had hidden, was a gift, a curse, a promise, or a lie, whether the rabbits, the hare, the moonlight, the shadows, were a guide, a test, a comfort, or a danger. She thought that perhaps she had been born to be a queen, a king, a hare, a rabbit, a dreamer, a lover, a wanderer, a guardian, a thief, a liar, a truth‑seeker, a soul, a spirit, a voice, a silence, a breath, a heartbeat, a pulse, a whisper, a shout, a cry, a sigh, a laugh, a tear, a promise, a vow, a secret.
