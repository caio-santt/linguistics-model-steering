and each thought swirled, looping, looping, looping, like a lazy river in a mind that never settles. She felt, in that quiet hush, the weight of a name that was not hers, and he felt, in that same hush, the pulse of a heart that beat for her. She wondered, in a voice that trembled, whether the joy that had poured out on Tuesday would stay, or whether it would fade, like a candle in the wind. He listened, in a silence that was thick, and he felt, in that silence, a tremor that was not his own. She imagined, in a cloud of memory, the pigeons that had fluttered, and he imagined, in that same cloud, the car that had moved off. She felt, in a breath, the echo of rice that had fallen, and he felt, in that echo, a laugh that was not his. She knew, in a sudden flash, that the happiness was fragile, and he knew, in that flash, that it could be stolen. She whispered, in a hush, that she was still learning, and he whispered, in that hush, that he was still learning. She saw, in a glance, the way his nose twitched, and he saw, in that glance, the way her eyes twitched. She thought, in a maze of thoughts, that she could not be the same as he, and he thought, in that maze, that she could not be the same as him. She felt, in a moment, the pull of a name, and he felt, in that moment, the pull of a laugh. She imagined, in a swirl, the way the lake glowed, and he imagined, in that swirl, the way the mountains stood. She knew, in a whisper, that she was Mrs. Ernest, and he knew, in that whisper, that he was Ernest. She wondered, in a sudden rush, whether she would ever feel, inside, that she was herself again, and he wondered, in that rush, whether he would ever feel, inside, that he was himself again. She looked, in a flicker, at the way he smiled, and he looked, in that flicker, at the way she smiled.
