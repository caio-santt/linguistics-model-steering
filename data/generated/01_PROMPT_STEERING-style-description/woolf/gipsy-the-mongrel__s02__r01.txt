She remembered, as if the memory itself were a rope, the way his hand had trembled when he spoke of the dog, the way the words had slipped from him like water over stone. It was not that she doubted him; she did not doubt him, she only felt, as she often felt, that the past was a place where things were both solid and shifting, like a picture that had been painted and then peeled back to reveal a different hue underneath. She could almost feel the texture of the story, the way it brushed against her own thoughts, how it made her feel, as if she were listening to a song that had been composed long before she had been born.

The room seemed to hum with that hum, a low hum that was not a sound but a feeling, a presence that pressed against her chest. She was a woman of few words, but when she spoke, it was as if each word were a thread that she pulled from the air and wound around the other people’s minds. She spoke of Hector, of the way the dog had wagged his tail like a metronome, of the way the dog had made the world feel small and safe, and she spoke of the way the man had been proud, proud of his place in Surrey, proud of the way he had looked at her, at the way he had looked at her as if she were a thing that could be owned or that could be owned by him.

She saw, as she did often, the way people were drawn to each other, how they could be pulled by a thread that seemed invisible. She saw the way Tom had tapped his forehead, the way Lucy had said that she was a gentleman, the way the woman had said that she had a sense, the way she had said that she was a dog of character. She saw how all of those people, each of them, were trying to make sense of a world that was not as simple as it seemed. She saw how they were trying to find a place where they could be, where they could exist, where they could be free, where they could be something more than what they were.

She thought of the way she had seen the dog, the way she had seen the dog as if it were a thing that had to be understood, as if it were a thing that had to be known.
