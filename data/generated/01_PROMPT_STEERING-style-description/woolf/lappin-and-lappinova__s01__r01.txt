She thought, as the rain beat against the panes, that the world was a flat, wide river of sound, and she, with her hands, was a boat that could drift on it. She felt the tap of the drops, a rhythm, a pulse that matched the thump of her own heart, which beat in a pattern she could not name, but could feel. She listened to the wind, to the rustle of leaves, to the quiet that fell when the fire sputtered. She thought of the rabbit, of the way his nose twitched, as if it were a secret code, a signal that told her that he was listening, that he was there, that he was alive. She wondered, she wondered, if he was a mirror, a copy, a reflection of her own mind, of her own thoughts. She wondered if he was a sign, a sign that something was wrong, that something was right. She wondered, she wondered, if she could find the answer in the way he moved, in the way he breathed, in the way he looked at her with a gaze that seemed to say, “I am here, I am you.”

She felt the weight of the moment, the heaviness of the day, the lightness of the night, the weight of the past, the lightness of the future. She felt the pull of the river, the pull of the wind, the pull of the rabbit. She felt that the rabbit was not a rabbit, that he was a story, a myth, a legend. She felt that she was part of that story, that she was part of that myth, that she was part of that legend. She felt that the rabbit was a guide, a guide that would show her the way, that would show her the truth, that would show her the path.

She saw the rabbit, he was there, he was quiet, he was still, he was a shadow, he was a shape. She saw the way his ears lifted, the way his nose twitched, the way his eyes looked at her, the way his paws touched the ground. She saw the way the wind moved the leaves, the way the fire crackled, the way the rain fell. She saw the way the world moved around them, the way the world moved inside them, the way the world moved in them. She saw that the rabbit was not a rabbit, that he was a story, that he was a legend, that he was a myth.
