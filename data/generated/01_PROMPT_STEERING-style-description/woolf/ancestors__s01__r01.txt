She paused, her breath a thin thread in the cramped air, and the room seemed to lean toward her, as if it could hear the way her mind turned its own questions into questions of its own. It was not that she feared the city, but the city felt like a cage, a place where she could not breathe the scent of wild grass, where every window was a small, flat glass that cut off the sky. She felt that she had to hold onto the memory of petals, of that softness that had once filled her hands, and she held them in a place that was not quite a hand but a thought, a whisper of the past that hummed against her ribs.

It was her mother who had taught her that a flower was a kind of promise, a promise that could be broken by a careless step, and she could not imagine herself stepping over one again. She thought of the way her mother had knelt among the roses, her fingers stained with soil, and she could almost feel the roughness of that soil against her own skin, even though she was now sitting on a chair that was a cold, hard thing. She remembered how her mother had never changed her dress from summer to winter, how she had always worn lace, and how that lace seemed to her now like a fragile veil over the past, a veil that she could see through but not touch.

She wondered whether she would ever be able to hold that same quiet reverence, or whether she would be forced to become a stranger to the simple things that had once been her sanctuary. She felt the weight of that question settle on her chest, heavy as a stone that had been left in a drawer. She could not bear to think that the world would be full of people who did not know what it meant to feel the weight of a flower, to feel the weight of a moment. She thought of Jack Renshaw, who had called her a lovely frock, and she felt the sharpness of his words, like a knife that cut through the softest cloth.

She remembered the starlit garden, the old trees that had stood there for years, and she felt herself as a small part of that long time, as if she were a leaf that had fallen and was now turning into something else. She imagined her father, his white linen coat, his smoking habit, and she felt a strange pull, as if her thoughts were trying to reach back to a time when she could see him, when he was not just a memory but a living thing.
