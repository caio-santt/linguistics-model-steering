and then she would, with a glance, shift her weight, and she would, without a word, turn her head, and she would, as if to say, “this is how it is,” and she would, with a gentle sigh, let the light fall across the floor, and she would, in that instant, let us feel that she was, in a way, listening to the pulse of the room, and she would, in a soft hush, bring the silence into a shape that was almost a shape of understanding, and she would, with her eyes, give us a look that was, in a sense, a promise that she would not let us feel alone. It was in that moment that I thought, that this was not just a dog, but a mirror of us, a reflection of our own quiet, unspoken thoughts. And she, with her small paws, would tap the floor, and she would, as if she were a metronome, keep the rhythm of our conversation, and she would, with a breath, remind us that we were not alone in our own thoughts. And she, with her tail, would wag, and she would, with a flick, signal that the world was not as it seemed, and she would, with a soft bark, say that the world was full of possibilities, and she would, with a gentle nudge, bring us back to the present, and she would, with a look, say that we were, in that moment, not alone. And we, with our own breath, would feel the weight of her presence, and we would, in that way, realize that we were, in a sense, being guided, and we would, with a smile, feel that she was, in her own way, guiding us. And she, with her own quiet, would, with a soft sigh, let us know that she had seen us, that she had felt us, and she would, with a gentle touch, remind us that we were not alone. And we, with our own hearts, would feel that she was, in a way, a companion, a friend, a guide, and she would, with her own quiet, keep us company. And she, with her own voice, would, in that way, remind us that we were not alone, that we were, in that sense, part of something larger, and she would, with a gentle wag, let us know that we were, in a way, not alone.
