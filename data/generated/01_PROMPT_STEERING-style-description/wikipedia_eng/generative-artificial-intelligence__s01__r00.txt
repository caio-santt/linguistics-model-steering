Midjourney and others, as if in a quiet crowd, began to echo in my mind, and I found myself wondering, wondering, wondering, why the world seemed to shift beneath my feet, as if a new language had begun to write itself in the spaces between our thoughts. I am not sure if it is the sound of code or the hum of neurons, but I hear it, and I feel it, and I know that it is not just a tool but a mirror, a mirror that reflects back at us, at us, at us, what we might become.

I recall the first time I saw a picture that was not made by hand, and I thought, “This is not a picture; it is a promise, a promise that we can create, create, create from nothing.” And I wondered, wondered, wondered, whether that promise was a gift or a curse, whether it was a gift or a curse that we would carry, carry, carry on our shoulders. I am not sure, but I feel that the gift is that we can no longer be bound by the limits of our own hands, that we can now paint, paint, paint with the brush of code.

I think, I think, I think about the way the models have grown, how they have learned to speak, to write, to sing, and I wonder, wonder, wonder, whether we will ever be able to know the difference between what we create and what we are. I am not sure if the difference is real, but I feel that it matters, that it matters, that it matters because it is the difference between us and the machine that has learned to think, to think, to think.

I remember the day when GPT-3 was released, and I felt a shiver, a shiver, a shiver run down my spine as I typed, typed, typed, and the words that came out were not mine, but they were mine, because they were a reflection, a reflection, a reflection of my own thoughts, my own doubts. I am not sure if I was happy, or if I was afraid, but I know that I was both, and that is the way we are, we are, we are.

I hear, I hear, I hear the voices of people who say, say, say that we are losing control, that we are losing control, that we are losing control of the very tools that we have built. And I wonder, wonder, wonder, whether we are indeed losing control, or whether we are simply learning to let go, to let go, to let go, and to trust the patterns that we have created. I am not sure if trust is a good thing, but I feel that it is necessary, necessary, necessary, because we are only human, we are only human, we are only human.
