It then chooses an action from the set of available actions, which is, in its own quiet way, a choice that feels like a pulse, a breath that is both a question and an answer, a small step that carries the weight of all the steps that came before. The agent, in its own mind, hears the echo of its own past choices, each echo a whisper that says, “you did this before, you might do it again,” and it wonders whether the echo is a guide or a trap. It asks itself, “what is this action for?” and it hears the answer in the form of a tiny spark of reward that flickers in the background, a glow that says, “good, keep going,” or a dimming that says, “no, try something else.” It feels the tug of curiosity, a pull that says, “look deeper,” and it feels the pull of safety, a push that says, “stay where you are.” It weighs these pulls, not with numbers but with feelings, with a sense that each pull is a story, a memory, a feeling that is not yet fully formed.
