Sivanandan, he had spoken, he had written, he had listened, he had felt the pulse of the city, the thrum beneath the pavements, the echo of boots in the dark, and he had watched the men, the three, as they slipped into the back, as they locked the door, as they spoke in hushed tones that carried the weight of history. He had known that they were not just thieves, but actors in a larger play, a drama that had begun in the streets of Lagos, in the cramped flats of Southwark, in the classrooms where teachers spoke of empire. He had known that they carried with them a memory that was not their own, a memory that had been stitched into them by generations.

The police, they had come, they had moved, they had set up their cameras, they had watched the feed, they had listened to the murmur of the men, and they had seen the flicker of fear in their eyes. The psychiatrist, he had sat, he had listened, he had noted the cadence of their speech, the way they spoke of freedom, of hunger, of betrayal, of the way the word "justice" seemed to hang in the air, heavy as a stone. He had told the officers that the men were not simply mad, but that they were caught in a web of anger, of hope, of a sense that the world had turned its back on them. He had suggested that the officers should speak to them as if they were children, if children had been taught to hate, if children had been taught to fight, if children had been taught to think that the only way to survive was to take what they needed.

The men, they had thought, they had imagined, they had feared. They had felt the weight of the world on their shoulders, they had felt the weight of the law on their backs. They had thought of the streets they had walked, the bars they had broken, the nights they had spent in the back of buses, the nights they had sat on the floor of their mothers' kitchens, the nights they had whispered to each other about a future that might never come. They had imagined a world where they could live without fear, where they could walk without looking over their shoulders, where they could speak without being silenced.

Franklin, he had been the one who had pulled the trigger, he had been the one who had decided to end his own life, he had been the one who had carried the weight of the group's expectations. He had been the one who had believed that the only way to make a difference was to take a stand, to take a life, to take a risk.
