After the day, the echo of sirens faded into a hush that seemed to hold its breath, and he, he, he—he who had once stood at the helm of that cramped room—felt the weight of what had been left behind. He knew that what lay ahead was not a simple ledger of events, but a maze of thoughts, a web of feelings that twisted like the cables that had once bound the doors. He, he, he, he, he—he who had watched the light cut through the glass, saw the way it fell on the faces of those inside, saw the way it fell on the faces of those outside, saw the way it fell on the faces of those who would later come to speak of it. He felt that the silence after the sirens was not silence at all, but a pause, a breath, a moment when the mind could begin to stitch together the fragments that had been torn apart by the storm.

He remembered the way the hostages had been released, one after another, like beads on a string, each bead a small relief, each bead a small grief. He remembered the way the first one had stepped out, a manager of a shop, his hands trembling, his eyes looking for something that was not there. He remembered the way the second had left, sick, his body weak, his mind still fighting the ache that had taken root in his chest. He remembered the way the third had not yet left, his mind still chained to the walls, his heart still beating a rhythm that was not his own. He remembered that the men, the men, the men—he who had known them, he who had heard them—had not been simple robbers, but something more, something that had been born from a desire that was both personal and collective.

He thought of Manca, the consul, who had tried to bridge the gap, who had offered to swap places, who had offered to bring a voice from the outside, but who had been denied.
