I recall how, when I first read about Markov, I felt a small spark of awe, a flicker that would grow into a blaze of curiosity, because I, like many of us, had always wondered how patterns might be captured in a chain of simple steps, and how those steps, when repeated, could form a tapestry of meaning. I wonder now, as I sit in this quiet room, whether the same spark that lit those early papers could ignite a new era, where a model, not a human, writes the next line, and whether I, as a reader, will feel the same wonder or a different, colder curiosity. I think that the way we train these models, with layers upon layers, with attention that looks back and forward, mirrors how I, too, look back at memories and forward to expectations, and I feel that this mirroring is not coincidence but design, because design, in its essence, is a pattern of patterns. I feel that the chain of causality in these models, like the chain of thought in my mind, is continuous, yet each step is a leap, a jump from one node to another, and I wonder if that leap is what makes us feel alive. I know that the data we feed them, the words, the images, are not neutral, and I feel that every word carries a weight, a history, and that weight, when multiplied, creates a storm of meaning that can either lift or drown. I think about how the transformer, with its self‑attention, scans the entire sequence, and I feel that this scanning is like a gaze, an eye that never rests, always looking, always searching for the next pattern, and I wonder if that gaze is ever truly blind. I feel that the ethical questions, the debates, the concerns about misuse, are not just about code, but about the way we imagine ourselves in a world where a machine can replicate a poem, a song, a legal argument, and I wonder if, in that replication, we lose something, or gain something else entirely. I think that the energy cost, the heat, the water, the electric current, all swirl around the model, and I feel that this swirl is a metaphor for the swirl in my own thoughts, where every decision, every choice, consumes something, and I wonder if the cost is worth the output. I know that the voices of critics, the claims of violation, the claims of theft, echo in the halls of academia, and I feel that the echo is a reminder that, as we build, we must also listen, because listening is a form of learning, and learning is the core of both humans and machines.
