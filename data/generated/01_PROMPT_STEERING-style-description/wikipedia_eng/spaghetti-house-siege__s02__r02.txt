the sentence fell like a stone, heavy, slow, inevitable, and it was not just the weight of the law that pressed on them, but the weight of their own selves, of the echoes that had built up in the dark hours before the dawn, of the echo of a gunshot that had been a confession, a self‑imposed end, a promise that the world could not hear. They sat in the cell, the walls cold, the bars clinking when the wind slipped through the cracks, and they felt the breath of the night settle over their heads, a shroud that was both comforting and cruel. I thought, as I watched them, that the night had turned them into something else, that the darkness had turned the men into shadows of themselves, that the silence had turned their voices into whispers that could not be heard by the outside world. I felt a pull, a tug, a pull that was not from the walls but from the inside, from the place where thoughts and memories mingle, where the past is a chain that holds them, where the present is a weight that cannot be lifted. I could not help but wonder what they felt when the judge’s voice echoed in the courtroom, when the words “not guilty” were entered on their behalf, when the judge’s decision was a verdict that was both a mercy and a punishment, a mercy that was a lie and a punishment that was a truth. I thought of the man who had visited them, Giovanni Scrano, who had been a hostage, who had become a friend, who had become a mirror that reflected the darkness inside them, and I wondered if that friendship was a sign of hope or a sign of a deeper wound, a wound that was not healed but merely covered by a bandage of Stockholm syndrome, a syndrome that was not a disease but a survival mechanism. I thought of the note, the note that had been written to a brother, a note that had spoken of a mission, of a warrior’s rest, of a joy that was a paradox, a paradox that was the most natural fate that awaited those who were conscious enough to try and do something about their pathetic state of existence. I thought that the note was a confession, a confession that had been a plea, a plea that had been a hope that had been a fear, a fear that had been a love, a love that had been a curse. I felt that the night was a place where the past met the future, where the past was a chain that held them, where the future was a light that could not be seen.
