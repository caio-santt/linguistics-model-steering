The sentence, a cold echo, hung in the air, and he felt it, felt it, felt it, as if the words themselves were a weight, a weight that pressed on his chest, his chest, his chest, until the breath seemed to tighten. He knew, knew, knew that the law had spoken, spoken, spoken, and that he would be a prisoner, a prisoner, a prisoner, of a system that had never cared to understand the hunger that gnawed at him. He thought of the note, the note, the note that had been found in his pocket, and he saw, saw, saw, the words he had written as a map of his own surrender. He wondered, wondered, wondered whether the note had been a confession or a warning, a warning that had been swallowed by the night.

In the cells, he found, found, found himself surrounded by silence, silence, silence, and yet the silence was not empty. It was full of the voices of others, others, others, who had come before him, before him, before him, and who had left their own marks. He listened, listened, listened to the muffled conversations that drifted through the bars, and he heard, heard, heard the echoes of a past that was not his, not his, not his. He felt, felt, felt a strange kinship with those voices, kinship that was not love but a recognition of the shared burden of being caught, caught, caught.

Giovanni, the hostage who had visited him, came into the cell one afternoon, a brief pause in the routine. He brought, brought, brought with him a small piece of bread, bread, bread, and he spoke, spoke, spoke in a voice that was soft, soft, soft, as if he were whispering to a child. He said, said, said that the world outside was a maze, maze, maze, and that they, they, they had to find their own way out of it. He asked, asked, asked if he could believe that the world would be kind, kind, kind, and he answered, answered, answered that kindness was a rare flower, a flower that grew only in the darkest places.

Davies, Dick, and Munroe, each of them, each of them, each of them, sat in a small cell, the walls close, close, close, and they talked, talked, talked about the past, the past, the past. They spoke of the robbery, the robbery, the robbery, and of the way the world had turned its back on them.
