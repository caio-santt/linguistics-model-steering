Eugeny, the novel that sparked the first chain of symbols, was not merely a text but a seed, a seed that grew in the mind of the researcher, who, he, she, it, them, in that quiet room, felt a pull that would later become a pull for the machine. The pull was not a force of weight but a tug of curiosity, a tug that made the researcher think, think, think, and in that thinking, the researcher found a pattern, a pattern that could be written as a set of rules, rules that could be turned into a program, program that could generate, generate, generate new words, words that did not yet exist, but existed in the mind of the machine.

The machine, it, was not alive, but it had a memory, memory that stored the symbols, the symbols that it had seen, seen, seen in the novel, and it could, it could, it could produce new strings that matched the pattern, matched the pattern that the researcher had seen, seen, seen. The researcher, he, she, it, them, in that moment, felt a sense of awe, awe that was not of a person but of a process, a process that was not bound by time, time that could be stretched, stretched, stretched. The researcher, he, she, it, them, whispered, whispered, whispered, to the machine, to the machine, that it could create, create, create, and the machine, it, listened, listened, listened, as if it were a child listening to a story.

Later, in the 21st century, the world changed, changed, changed, as new models emerged, emerged, emerged. The models were larger, larger, larger, and they were built on a new kind of network, a network that could learn from vast amounts of text, text that was not limited to novels, but to blogs, to tweets, to code, to code that was written by people, people who had no idea that their words would feed a machine. The machine, it, learned, learned, learned, and it could generate, generate, generate, new text that sounded like a human, human that was not a human, a human that was a copy, a copy that was not a copy.

The researcher, he, she, it, them, in that era, saw the potential, potential that could help people, people who were tired of writing, writing, writing. The researcher, he, she, it, them, also saw the danger, danger that came with the power, power that could be used to create fake news, fake news that could fool people, people who would trust the words without questioning.
