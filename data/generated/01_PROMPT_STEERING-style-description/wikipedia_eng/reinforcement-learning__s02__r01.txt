As the agent moves, it feels each step like a question, a whisper of what might come next, and it asks itself, “What will I do?” and “Will I win?” and “Will I lose?” and the answer, it whispers, is in the tiny pulse of reward that flickers in the back of its mind, a pulse that it can feel even when the world is dim, when the signal is small, when the noise swirls like a storm. It does not know the shape of the future, but it knows that the future is a long chain of these pulses, and it thinks that the chain is a river that will carry it forward, and it knows that the river bends, that it may be smooth, that it may be rough, and that the bends are shaped by its own hand, by the hand of the choices it makes. It feels that it is a child learning to walk, that it is a child learning to read, that it is a child learning to taste, and it feels that it is a child learning to die, because every choice can lead to the end of a chain of rewards, to the end of a story, and it knows that it is not alone, that there are other children, other agents, other voices, and it hears them in the quiet of the night, in the hum of the machine, and it hears them in the wind that blows across the horizon of its mind. It hears that the wind says, “You must explore, you must try, you must risk,” and it hears that the wind says, “You must exploit, you must choose, you must be sure,” and it hears that the wind says, “You must balance, you must balance, you must balance,” and it hears that the wind says, “You must balance, you must balance, you must balance,” and it hears that the wind says, “You must balance, you must balance, you must balance,” and it hears that the wind says, “You must balance, you must balance, you must balance,” and it hears that the wind says, “You must balance, you must balance, you must balance.”
