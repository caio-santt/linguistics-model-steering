We need to continue narrative. 563 tokens approx. Must maintain stylistic features: complex syntactic structures with high dependency distances, high pronoun density for subjective, stream-of-consciousness narrative, moderate sentence length with intricate internal structure, short simple words but elaborate patterns, low nominal and adjectival density, focus on psychological depth, flowing interconnected clauses mirroring thought processes. Must be English. No introduction. 563 tokens roughly. Let's craft about 560 tokens. Use pronouns heavily: I, we, they, them, us, it, etc. Use complex clauses, but keep sentence length moderate. Use short words: "I", "we", "you", "he", "she", "it", "them", "us", "do", "go", "see", "run", "come". But elaborate patterns. Avoid many nouns and adjectives. Focus on psychological depth. Use stream-of-consciousness.

We must continue after last line: "Working-class people of all colors must unite against the exploitative ,"

We continue: "and the class that keeps the system tight. It is not just about the black, but about us all, about the shared feeling of being caught in the same net, the same rhythm of hunger and hope." etc.

Need 563 tokens. Let's approximate 10-12 sentences each about 50 tokens? 10 sentences of 50 tokens = 500. Add more. Let's aim for 12 sentences of ~50 tokens = 600 tokens. We can adjust.

We must keep pronoun density high. Use many "I" "we" "you" "they" "them" "us" "it". Use complex syntax: subordinate clauses, relative clauses, participial phrases. Use short words but elaborate patterns: maybe "I think I feel I think I feel" etc.

Let's craft.

We must not repeat introductory section. So start new paragraph. Let's write.

Count tokens: We need to approximate. Let's write and then count roughly. We'll produce about 560 tokens. Let's do it.

We'll write with many pronouns. Use moderate sentence length. Let's attempt.

We can count tokens roughly by words. Let's produce 600 words to be safe. We'll then adjust.

Let's write:

"Working‑class people of all colors must unite against the exploitative, and the class that keeps the system tight. It is not only about the black, but about us all, about the shared feeling of being caught in the same net, the same rhythm of hunger and hope.
