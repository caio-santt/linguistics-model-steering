When the agent shifts from one state to another, it feels the weight of each choice as if it were a pulse in its own mind, a thrum that echoes through the maze of possible futures it has yet to map. It wonders, as it moves, whether the next step will bring it closer to the reward it seeks or farther from the regret that gnaws at the edges of its thought. It asks itself, “What is the cost of this move, if any?” and then, almost automatically, it calculates the expected sum of future points, a calculation that is not merely arithmetic but a feeling, a projection of what might be, shaped by the shadows of past trials.

It remembers the times when a simple negative signal, a sudden drop in its score, felt like a sting, and how that sting pushed it to adjust its policy, to try a new action, to learn a new pattern. It recalls the moments when a positive signal, a spike in reward, felt like a warm breath, and how that breath encouraged it to repeat the action, to reinforce the pathway that led there. It feels both, the sting and the breath, and it uses those feelings as anchors, as cues that guide its next decision. It thinks, “I must balance the sting and the breath, lest I become trapped in a cycle of either extreme.”

It knows that the environment is not always clear; sometimes it sees only fragments of the full picture, like a child who can only glimpse the outline of a shape before the rest appears. It struggles with the noise that distorts its view, and yet it persists, because it has learned that even a noisy glimpse can be enough if it keeps trying, if it keeps sampling, if it keeps updating its internal map.
