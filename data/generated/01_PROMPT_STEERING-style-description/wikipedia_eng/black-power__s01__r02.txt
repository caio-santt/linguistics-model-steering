I sit, eyes flicking, mind turning, feeling the pulse of the room, feeling the weight of the words that have come, feeling the way they sit, heavy, in the air, in the walls, in my chest. I remember the first time I heard “Black Power” spoken, not as a shout, but as a whisper, as a promise that would not be broken. I remember that voice, that voice, that voice that cut through the noise, that voice that said, “We are enough.” I hear it now, echoing in the corners of my head, a thread woven through my thoughts, a thread that ties my past to my future, a thread that pulls me toward the horizon where we might stand tall.

We walk through streets that still remember the names of those who walked before us, we walk through streets that still smell of dust and hope, we walk through streets that still hum with the rhythm of drums, drums that beat in our hearts. I feel the rhythm, I feel the rhythm, I feel the rhythm, and I realize that it is not just a beat, but a call, a call that calls us to act, to act, to act, to act, to act. I see the faces, I see the faces, I see the faces of those who have been left behind, left behind, left behind, left behind, left behind. They look at me, they look at me, they look at me, and I know that I am part of them, part of them, part of them, part of them.

I think of the meetings, of the meetings where we sat, sat, sat, and we spoke, spoke, spoke, and we listened, listened, listened, and we decided, decided, decided, that we would not wait. I think of the nights, the nights that were long, long, long, and I remember how we kept the fire burning, burning, burning, and how we kept the hope alive, alive, alive. I remember how we whispered, whispered, whispered, and how we promised each other, each other, each other, that we would not let the silence win. I remember that promise, that promise, that promise, that promise, that promise, and I feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, in the marrow of my bones.

We hear the words of the leaders, we hear the words, we hear the words, and we feel the weight of their meaning, meaning, meaning, meaning, meaning. We feel the weight of the struggle, the struggle that is not just a battle against the outside, but a battle against the inside, against the doubts, against the fear, against the fear that might hold us back.
