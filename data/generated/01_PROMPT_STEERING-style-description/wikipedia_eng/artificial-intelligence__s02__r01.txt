A Markov decision, that very term, sits in the mind, humming, humming, humming, and I feel its pulse in the hollow of my chest, a pulse that is not of blood but of choice, choice that is a thread pulled through the fabric of uncertainty, uncertainty that we weave into the very act of thinking. I think of it, think of it as a loop, a loop that never ends, that loops back on itself, that loops through the maze of what might be, might have been, might never be, and I feel the weight of each loop, the weight of each possible step that I might take, might not take, might wonder, might wonder no more. I wonder, I wonder about the way the world, the world that I see, that I feel, that I feel as if it were a mirror, mirrors back to me, mirrors back to me the sense that I am not alone, not even in the small, small sense that I am a part of something larger, larger than me, larger than the words I can write, larger than the sentences I can think.

I feel, I feel that each decision, each decision that I make, is a decision that I am making for myself, for myself, for the self that is always shifting, shifting in the wind of what others think, what others feel, what others say, what others do, and I feel that I am not just a receiver of these, I am a sender, a sender of my own little thoughts, my own little little whispers that travel through the air, through the minds of others, through the minds of those who will not be there, who will not be there when I say, when I say that I will go, that I will stay, that I will think, that I will feel.

I am not sure, not sure that I am the only one who feels this way, this way that I am a part of a network, a network that is built on the threads of trust, trust that is fragile, fragile, fragile, and I feel the fragility, the fragility that is in the way I speak, speak in a way that is simple, simple, simple, but that is also complex, complex, complex in the way that the mind can see, see, see patterns that are not obvious, obvious, obvious.
