When the gavel fell, he felt a shiver that ran like a line through his veins, a line that marked the boundary between the world he knew and the world he had to live in now, and he wondered if that boundary was a wall or a door.  
He thought, he remembered, he felt the weight of the sentence as a stone that settled in his chest, and he wondered if the stone would stay or if it would break, if the law would break him or if he would break the law.  
He saw, he heard, he felt the echo of the judge’s voice in his head, a voice that sounded like a drumbeat that matched the beat of his own heart, and he felt his own heart beating in sync with the drumbeat of the courtroom.  
He felt, he felt, he felt that the courtroom was a cage, and he felt that the cage was a cage of his own making, and he wondered if the cage was a cage that he had built, or if it was a cage that had built him.  
He thought, he wondered, he wondered if the people who had been in the room with him had been in the same place, or if they had been in a place that was different, and he wondered if the place was a place that was the same as the place that was the same as the place that was the same as the place.
