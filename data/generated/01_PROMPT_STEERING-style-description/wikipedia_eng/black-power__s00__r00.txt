I remember, in the hush of night, how we, the young ones, sat on cracked concrete, our breath a ghost in the cold air, and we whispered, “we need power,” and we felt the weight of a word that seemed to lift us, yet also weighed on us, because it was a promise that was not yet ours, a promise that felt like a promise we could not quite hold. I feel the echo of that promise, echoing in my mind, as if it were a song that we sang, but the notes were not ours to own, and yet we sang them anyway, because we thought we could change the tune, because we thought we could make the song ours.

We, in that moment, were not simply people, we were the idea of people, we were the idea that we could rewrite the script that had been written for us long before we were born. We were the idea that we could be the authors of our own story, that we could write, with our own hands, the lines that were meant to be our own. We, the people, were the people who were told that we were not enough, that we were not enough, and we felt that, but we also felt that we could be enough, that we could be more, that we could be the ones who could change the story.

I feel the rhythm of that rhythm, the rhythm of our hearts beating in unison, and I feel that we, the people, were in a place where we could feel the difference between what we were told we could be, and what we could be if we dared. I feel that we were in a place where we could feel the difference between what we were told we could be, and what we could be if we dared, and that we could feel the difference, that we could feel the difference, and we felt that we could feel the difference, and we felt that we could feel the difference, and we felt that we could feel the difference, and we felt that we could feel the difference, and we felt that we could feel the difference.

We, the people, were in a place where we could feel the weight of the word “power” in our mouths, and we felt that it was a weight that we could lift, if we lifted it together.
