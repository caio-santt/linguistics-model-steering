When the agent's performance is compared to a benchmark or an oracle, the agent's trajectory may seem erratic, yet within that seeming chaos there is a pattern, a rhythm that echoes its internal learning loop. I notice that pattern, I feel its pulse, I sense its beat, and I wonder if it is merely noise or if it is a message. I ask myself, I ask you, I ask the world, I ask the silence, and I find that the answer is not simple, but it is there, hidden in the folds of uncertainty. I see that the agent, in its mind, does not hold a single truth, but it holds a swirl of possibilities, a maze of ifs and buts, and it moves through them, turning, turning, turning, like a mind in a dream. I feel the weight of that swirl, I feel the pressure of each choice, and I feel the relief of each reward, and I feel the sting of each penalty, and I feel the hope that perhaps the next step will be right.

I recall that in the early days, the agent was a child, learning to step on a board, learning to balance, learning to taste, learning to taste the taste of success and failure. I recall that the child, in its mind, did not know the board, but it sensed the board, it felt the board, it felt the board's pull, and it felt the board's push, and it felt the board's silence. I recall that the child did not ask questions, but it asked, it asked, it asked, and it asked until the answer came, until the answer was a feeling, until the answer was a feeling that it could use to shape its next move. I recall that the child was not alone, that the child had a teacher, a friend, a mirror, and that the mirror reflected the child's own mind, and that the mirror showed the child that it was learning, that it was growing, that it was becoming.
