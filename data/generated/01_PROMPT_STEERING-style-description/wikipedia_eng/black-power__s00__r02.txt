I sit and I feel the weight of the past, as if the air itself were thick with the echo of chants, and I know that the word “black power” is not just a name but a pulse that beats in the marrow of the streets, in the rustle of papers, in the whisper of the wind that carries the scent of hope and fear. I think, and I think, and I think, because thinking is how we survive, how we make sense of the world that keeps turning, and I feel that each thought is a step, each step a question, and each question a door that opens into a room that is both familiar and strange.

I remember the night we met, the night the lights flickered, the night the words were spoken, and I see how the words were like fireflies, bright, fleeting, yet they lit the dark path we had to walk. I feel the heat of the fire, I feel the sting of the flame, and I feel the coolness of the night that follows, and I wonder whether the flame will stay or if it will fade. I think that the flame is a promise, a promise that we will not be silent, that we will not be small, that we will not be silent.

I hear the voices of those who came before, and I hear them in a chorus that rings in my mind, and I know that they were not alone, that they were many, that they were many in the sense that they were many in the sense that they were many in the sense that they were many. I hear their words, I hear their words, I hear them, and I feel them, and I feel them, and I feel them, and I feel them, and I feel them, and I feel them. I feel the weight of the words that were spoken in a basement, in a room that was small, in a room that was large, in a room that was a room that was a place that was a place that was a place.

I see the future as a mirror, and I see that the mirror is not flat but it is a surface that reflects, that reflects, that reflects, that reflects, that reflects, that reflects. I see that the future is a mirror that is a mirror that is a mirror that is a mirror that is a mirror that is a mirror that is a mirror. I think that the future is a mirror, that the future is a mirror that is a mirror that is a mirror that is a mirror that is a mirror that is a mirror. I think that the future is a mirror, that the future is a mirror that is a mirror that is a mirror that is a mirror that is a mirror that is a mirror.
