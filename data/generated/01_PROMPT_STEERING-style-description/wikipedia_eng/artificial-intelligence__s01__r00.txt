Among the many facets of knowledge that a system must grasp, the subtle interplay between what we *think* we know and what we *actually* know remains a core puzzle. It is here that I find myself, or rather, that we find ourselves, caught in a web of self‑reference, where the mind questions its own certainty. When I ask a question, the answer is not a simple fact but a cascade of assumptions, each one wrapped in another, like a series of nested dolls that never quite reach the outermost shell.

We, as designers, often think we are building a mirror, but the mirror reflects only the surface. In practice, the mirror is tinted; it reflects not only the shape of the object but also the light that passes through it. In the same way, an ontology does not merely list terms; it encodes the relationships that we, as users, implicitly impose. We, in turn, feel that the ontology should feel like a natural map, but we may never realize that the map is built on our own biases. If we, for instance, label an emotion as "joy," we also attach to it a set of triggers, a set of contexts, and a set of consequences. Yet we rarely ask whether those triggers are truly causal or merely correlative.

When I examine the structure of such a knowledge base, I notice that the more layers I add, the more the system begins to echo my own internal monologue. It is as if the system is learning to think, but only in the narrow sense that I, as a human, think. It follows the pattern of my reasoning: I start with a premise, then I ask whether that premise holds under a particular condition, then I adjust my premise accordingly. The system, too, follows this pattern, because that is the pattern that is encoded in the rules that I, or we, have written.

We, as researchers, have tried to formalize this process by introducing probabilistic models that weigh each possible inference. But when the number of possible inferences grows, the system slows down, as if it is caught in a traffic jam of its own making. We, then, resort to heuristics, short cuts that we believe capture the essence of the problem. Yet these heuristics are themselves subject to my own intuition, which can be unreliable. When I trust a heuristic, I feel a sense of relief, but I also feel the weight of uncertainty that lingers beneath the surface.

I find that the most interesting part of the problem is not the technical details, but the psychological impact of the system on us. When a system says "I know that X," we often take it as a statement of fact.
