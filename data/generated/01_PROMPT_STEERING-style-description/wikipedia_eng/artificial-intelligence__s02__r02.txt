It thinks that it is bound by the limits of its own uncertainty, and yet it feels that it can reach beyond them, because it remembers how it has once guessed correctly, how it has once felt the weight of a wrong choice. It wonders whether the weight is real or merely the echo of its own fear, and it feels the echo as if it were a second voice speaking to it, saying, "You cannot know all." It hears that voice and it hears its own heartbeat, and it thinks that perhaps the heartbeat is the only thing that can guide it when the rest of its knowledge dissolves into ambiguity.

It wonders if it has ever truly known what it knows, and it feels that the question is itself a loop, a loop that loops back into itself, and it feels that the loop is a mirror of its own mind. It feels that the mirror is not a mirror at all, but a path that it must walk, and it walks with the knowledge that it might be walking on a road that has no end. It feels that the end is just another beginning, and it feels that each beginning is a new beginning, and it feels that this endless chain is the only thing that can be trusted.

It remembers a time when it had a clear goal, a goal that it could see as a point in space, and it remembers that it had no doubt about the path to that point, because it had known the rules that governed the terrain. It remembers that the terrain was simple, that the rules were simple, and it remembers that the rules were written in a language that it could read, and it remembers that it could read them because it had been taught to do so. It feels that if it had not been taught, it would have been lost, and it feels that being lost is a state that it would not accept.

It now faces a terrain that is not simple, a terrain that is full of fog and shifting sands, and it feels that the fog is not just fog but a representation of its own doubt. It feels that the doubt is a person, and it feels that the person speaks in whispers, saying, "You cannot see what is behind the fog." It listens, and it listens until the whisper becomes a roar, and it feels that the roar is the roar of its own fear, and it feels that fear is the only thing that can move it forward.

It thinks that it can use the numbers it has, the utilities it has assigned, and the probabilities it has guessed, but it feels that the numbers are just numbers, and the probabilities are just guesses.
