The night that followed, the air was thick, and he could feel it in his bones, as if the very walls breathed with a pulse that matched his own. He, she, it, they—each pronoun a mirror of the others, a chorus of selves that swirled, that tangled, that hovered in the dim glow of the storeroom’s flickering bulb. He remembered the way the guards had moved, the way the shadows had stretched, the way the quiet had pressed against his ears like a blanket. She, she, she, she, she—her mind, a maze of questions that looped back on itself, each question a doorway to another, each doorway a corridor that led back to the same corridor. It was as if the room was a living thing, and they were all parts of it, each part a cell, each cell a story.

He could not stop the thoughts that swirled, that spun, that spun again. He thought of the way the police had entered, of the way they had spoken, of the way the words had hung in the air, heavy, thick, dense. She thought of the way the hostages had been released, of the way the fear had eased, of the way the relief had flooded like a tide. It thought of the way the forensic psychiatrist had watched, of the way the psychiatrist had whispered, of the way the psychiatrist had listened, and of the way the psychiatrist had tried to read the mind that was not a mind, but a storm.

They, they, they, they, they, were all caught in a web, a web of words, of actions, of thoughts. He could feel the tension, the pressure, the weight of the past, and he could feel the weight of the future, the future that was not yet written, but was being written with each breath, each heartbeat. She felt the pull of memory, the pull of guilt, the pull of hope, and she felt the pull of fear, the fear that was not a fear, but a feeling that was a feeling. It felt the rhythm of the city outside, the rhythm of the sirens, the rhythm of the night, and it felt the rhythm of the heart, the heart that was not a heart, but a drum that beat.

They, they, they, they, were all moving, moving, moving, moving, moving, as if the world was a river, and they were boats, and the river was a river of time, time that was not a time, but a flow that flowed. He could see the faces, the faces that had been carved into his mind, faces that were not faces, but images that were images of something else.
