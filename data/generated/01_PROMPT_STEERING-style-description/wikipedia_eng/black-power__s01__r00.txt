I think, I feel, I sense the weight of the word “black power” settling like dust on the floor of a room that never truly closes. We are all, we are all, we are all caught in its echo, in the way it drips from the ceiling, in the way it whispers, in the way it shouts, in the way it bends our minds, in the way it pushes our hands to the edge of the next step, in the way it pulls us back to the beginning, in the way it asks, in the way it demands, in the way it offers. I remember the first time I heard it, the first time I heard it as a shout, the first time I heard it as a prayer, the first time I heard it as a song, the first time I heard it as a promise that we could own our own future, that we could own our own path, that we could own our own voice.

I remember the way it rode the wind, the way it rode the breath, the way it rode the rhythm of a drum, the way it rode the rhythm of a heart, the way it rode the rhythm of a mind, the way it rode the rhythm of a soul. I remember the way it made us feel, the way it made us see, the way it made us think, the way it made us wonder, the way it made us ask, the way it made us answer, the way it made us believe. I remember the way it made us feel, the way it made us feel that we were not alone, that we were not small, that we were not powerless, that we were not forgotten, that we were not denied, that we were not silenced.

We feel, we see, we hear, we taste, we touch, we know, we do, we dream. We are all, we are all, we are all, we are all, we are all. I feel, I feel, I feel, I feel, I feel, I feel, I feel, I feel, I feel, I feel, I feel, I feel. The word “black power” is not just a label, it is a call, it is a call that rings in the mind, that rings in the heart, that rings in the chest, that rings in the bones, that rings in the skin, that rings in the breath. The call is not just a call to stand, it is a call to stand, a call to stand, a call to stand, a call to stand, a call to stand, a call to stand, a call to stand, a call to stand, a call to stand, a call to stand, a call to stand, a call to stand, a call to stand.
