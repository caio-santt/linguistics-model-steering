people in this country to unite , to recognize their heritage , to build a sense of community . It is a call for black people to define their own goals , to lead their own organizations . `` [ 21 ] Variants Black power adherents believed in black autonomy , with a variety of tendencies such as black nationalism , black self-determination , and black separatism . Such positions caused friction with leaders of the mainstream Civil Rights Movement , and thus the two movements have sometimes been viewed as inherently antagonistic . Civil Rights leaders often proposed passive , non-violent tactics while the black power movement felt that , in the words of Stokely Carmichael and Charles V. Hamilton , `` a 'non-violent ' approach to civil rights is an approach black people can not afford and a luxury white people do not deserve . `` [ 22 ] However , many groups and individuals—including Rosa Parks , [ 23 ] Robert F.

Though the Panthers considered themselves to be at war with the prevailing white supremacist power structure , they were not at war with all whites , but rather with those ( mostly white ) individuals empowered by the injustices of the structure and responsible for its reproduction . Bobby Seale , chairman and co-founder of the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense , was outspoken about this issue . His stance was that the oppression of black people was a result of economic exploitation . In his book Seize the Time , he states that `` In our view it is a class struggle between the massive proletarian working class and the small , minority ruling class . Working-class people of all colors must unite against the exploitative ,
