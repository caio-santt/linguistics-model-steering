themselves . At 3:40 am they told the police that they were giving up . After the hostages came out first—all unharmed—the police told the three men to come out one at a time . The first two threw their guns out and followed ; as police led them away there was a gunshot from the room , where Davies had shot himself in the stomach with a .22 rimfire revolver . [ 38 ] In his pocket police found a note he had written to his brother just before the robbery : Today I set out on a mission for the people . If things go wrong I shall pass over to the warrior 's rest . So if this note reaches you , it would mean that I am dead . You must accept what happens to me as it should be accepted—with joy—because it is the most natural fate that awaits any of us blacks conscious enough to try and do something about our pathetic state of existence . [ 39 ] Aftermath Davies was taken to St George 's Hospital where he underwent an operation ; the bullet was not removed during the process . The hostages were also taken to the same hospital for a check-up , but none needed treatment . They then gave preliminary statements to the police at Cannon Row police station . [ 30 ] [ 40 ] While on remand , Davies went on hunger strike . He was visited regularly by Giovanni Scrano , one of the hostages from the siege , who had built up a relationship with Davies during the incident ; [ 41 ] the relationship was later identified as an example of Stockholm syndrome . [ 42 ] The trial opened on 8 June 1976 . As well as Davies , Dick and Munroe , three accomplices were present , charged with different offences , including assisting the robbery ( the getaway driver ) , supplying firearms , and conspiracy charges . Davies , Dick and Munroe refused to accept the legitimacy of the court . When asked how they pleaded to the charges , Davies shouted `` We 've stopped pleading—we 've been pleading for 500 years . This is n't a trial—it 's a lynching party . `` [ 43 ] The three men turned their backs on the court and talked between themselves . The judge , Mervyn Griffith-Jones , ordered that the three men be taken back to their cells and that a plea of not guilty be entered on their behalf . [ 43 ] One of the accomplices , Lillo Termine , pleaded guilty to the charges of conspiracy to rob the restaurant . Police said that he had been the one behind the robbery , and had planned it to pay off gambling debts . [ 44 ] [ 45 ] The trial ended on 30 June . Davies , Dick and Munroe were sentenced to 22 ,
