11 ] This growth accelerated further after 2017 with the transformer architecture . [ 12 ] In the 2020s , an ongoing period of rapid progress in advanced generative AI became known as the AI boom . Generative AI 's ability to create and modify content has led to several unintended consequences and harms , which has raised ethical concerns about AI 's long-term effects and potential existential risks , prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology . Goals The general problem of simulating ( or creating ) intelligence has been broken into subproblems . These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display . The traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of AI research . [ a ] Reasoning and problem-solving Early researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions . [ 13 ] By the late 1980s and 1990s , methods were developed for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information , employing concepts from probability and economics . [ 14 ] Many of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a `` combinatorial explosion '' : They become exponentially slower as the problems grow . [ 15 ] Even humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction that early AI research could model . They solve most of their problems using fast , intuitive judgments . [ 16 ] Accurate and efficient reasoning is an unsolved problem . Knowledge representation An ontology represents knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts . Knowledge representation and knowledge engineering [ 17 ] allow AI programs to answer questions intelligently and make deductions about real-world facts . Formal knowledge representations are used in content-based indexing and retrieval , [ 18 ] scene interpretation , [ 19 ] clinical decision support , [ 20 ] knowledge discovery ( mining `` interesting '' and actionable inferences from large databases ) , [ 21 ] and other areas . [ 22 ] A knowledge base is a body of knowledge represented in a form that can be used by a program . An ontology is the set of objects , relations , concepts , and properties used by a particular domain of knowledge . [ 23 ] Knowledge bases need to represent things such as objects , properties , categories , and relations between objects ; [ 24 ] situations , events , states , and time ; [ 25 ] causes and effects ; [ 26 ] knowledge about knowledge ( what we know about what other people know ) ; [ 27 ] default reasoning ( things that humans assume are true until they are told differently and will remain true even when other facts are changing ) ; [ 28 ] and many other aspects and domains of knowledge .
