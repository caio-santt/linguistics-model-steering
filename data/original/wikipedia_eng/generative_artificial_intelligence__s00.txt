Generative artificial intelligence ( Generative AI , GenAI , [ 1 ] or GAI ) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that uses generative models to produce text , images , videos , audio , software code or other forms of data . [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] These models learn the underlying patterns and structures of their training data and use them to produce new data [ 5 ] [ 6 ] based on the input , which often comes in the form of natural language prompts . [ 7 ] [ 8 ] Generative AI tools have become more common since the AI boom in the 2020s . This boom was made possible by improvements in transformer-based deep neural networks , particularly large language models ( LLMs ) . Major tools include chatbots such as ChatGPT , Copilot , Gemini , Claude , Grok , and DeepSeek ; text-to-image models such as Stable Diffusion , Midjourney , and DALL-E ; and text-to-video models such as Veo and Sora . [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] Technology companies developing generative AI include OpenAI , xAI , Anthropic , Meta AI , Microsoft , Google , DeepSeek , and Baidu . [ 7 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] Generative AI is used across many industries , including software development , [ 16 ] healthcare , [ 17 ] finance , [ 18 ] entertainment , [ 19 ] customer service , [ 20 ] sales and marketing , [ 21 ] art , writing , [ 22 ] fashion , [ 23 ] and product design . [ 24 ] The production of generative AI systems requires large scale data centers using specialized chips which require a lot of electricity for processing and water for cooling . [ 25 ] Generative AI has raised many ethical questions and governance challenges as it can be used for cybercrime , or to deceive or manipulate people through fake news or deepfakes . [ 26 ] [ 27 ] Even if used ethically , it may lead to mass replacement of human jobs . [ 28 ] The tools themselves have been criticized as violating intellectual property laws , since they are trained on copyrighted works . [ 29 ] The material and energy intensity of the AI systems has raised concerns about the environmental impact of AI , especially in light of the challenges created by the energy transition . History Main article : History of artificial intelligence Early history The first example of an algorithmically generated media is likely the Markov chain . Markov chains have long been used to model natural languages since their development by Russian mathematician Andrey Markov in the early 20th century . Markov published his first paper on the topic in 1906 , [ 30 ] [ 31 ] and analyzed the pattern of vowels and consonants in the novel Eugeny
