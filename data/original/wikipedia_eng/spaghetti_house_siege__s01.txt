that he was a captain in the BLF , [ 20 ] [ f ] but in a subsequent message said that the men were members of the Black Liberation Army , a Black Panther splinter group . [ 24 ] Davies made several demands to the police . He wanted two black prisoners released from prison , although he did not know that they had already been released . He also wanted the Home Secretary to visit the siege , an aircraft made available to fly to the West Indies and a radio for them to listen to the news broadcasts of the situation . Only the request for a radio was granted . [ 12 ] [ 25 ] [ 26 ] Initially the police considered that the siege may have been a terrorist incident , [ 21 ] [ g ] but were subsequently dismissive of any political motivation , and insisted that it was only ever a criminal action . [ 27 ] [ 28 ] Sir Robert Mark—the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police at the time of the siege—later wrote : From the outset it was rightly assumed that this was a simple armed robbery that had gone wrong and any attempts by Davies , the Nigerian , to represent it as a political act were received with the derision they clearly deserved . [ 12 ] Tony Soares , one of the founders of the BLF , told police he knew the three men , and offered to mediate , but his offer was turned down . [ 11 ] He added that the BLF was a peaceful organisation , and that it did not know of or support the robbery . [ 27 ] Jenny Bourne , the co-editor of Race & Class , knew all three men and thinks they `` probably had very different motives '' for the robbery . [ 28 ] Overall she considers the three , particularly Wesley Dick , were driven by the actualities of racism on the ground in Britain ... It was essentially the words of Angela Davis , George Jackson , Bobby Seale and Malcolm X that honed the resistance : `` Seize the time '' , `` Off the pigs '' , `` Fuck the man '' were the themes they transposed to Britain . [ 29 ] On the morning of 29 September—fifteen hours after the siege had begun—one of the hostages was released as a sign of good faith . He was a 59-year-old manager of one of the outlets . [ 19 ] On the second day another hostage was released after he fell ill. [ 25 ] During the course of the siege Mario Manca , the Italian consul general , attempted to liaise with the men , acting as a go-between . At one stage he offered to change places with one of the hostages who was unwell , but the offer was declined . [ 30 ]
