] In March 2023 , GPT-4 's release represented another jump in generative AI capabilities . A team from Microsoft Research controversially argued that it `` could reasonably be viewed as an early ( yet still incomplete ) version of an artificial general intelligence ( AGI ) system . `` [ 52 ] However , this assessment was contested by other scholars who maintained that generative AI remained `` still far from reaching the benchmark of 'general human intelligence ' '' as of 2023 . [ 53 ] Later in 2023 , Meta released ImageBind , an AI model combining multiple modalities including text , images , video , thermal data , 3D data , audio , and motion , paving the way for more immersive generative AI applications . [ 54 ] In December 2023 , Google unveiled Gemini , a multimodal AI model available in four versions : Ultra , Pro , Flash , and Nano . [ 55 ] The company integrated Gemini Pro into its Bard chatbot and announced plans for `` Bard Advanced '' powered by the larger Gemini Ultra model . [ 56 ] In February 2024 , Google unified Bard and Duet AI under the Gemini brand , launching a mobile app on Android and integrating the service into the Google app on iOS . [ 57 ] In March 2024 , Anthropic released the Claude 3 family of large language models , including Claude 3 Haiku , Sonnet , and Opus . [ 58 ] The models demonstrated significant improvements in capabilities across various benchmarks , with Claude 3 Opus notably outperforming leading models from OpenAI and Google . [ 59 ] In June 2024 , Anthropic released Claude 3.5 Sonnet , which demonstrated improved performance compared to the larger Claude 3 Opus , particularly in areas such as coding , multistep workflows , and image analysis . [ 60 ] Private investment in AI ( pink ) and generative AI ( green ) . Asia–Pacific countries are significantly more optimistic than Western societies about generative AI and show higher adoption rates . Despite expressing concerns about privacy and the pace of change , in a 2024 survey , 68 % of Asia-Pacific respondents believed that AI was having a positive impact on the world , compared to 57 % globally . [ 61 ] According to a survey by SAS and Coleman Parkes Research , China in particular has emerged as a global leader in generative AI adoption , with 83 % of Chinese respondents using the technology , exceeding both the global average of 54 % and the U.S. rate of 65 % . This leadership is further evidenced by China 's intellectual property developments in the field , with a UN report revealing that Chinese entities filed over 38,000 generative AI patents from 2014 to 2023 , substantially surpassing the United States in patent applications .
