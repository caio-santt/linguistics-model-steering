RAM ) ; Baltimore Afro-American reporter William Worthy , and Patricia Robinson of Third World Press , '' the Boggses had `` met with Malcolm in a Harlem luncheonette to discuss our proposal that he come to Detroit to help build the Organization for Black Power , '' but `` Malcolm ’ s response was that we should go ahead while he served the movement as an 'evangelist . ' '' [ 17 ] New York politician Adam Clayton Powell Jr. used the term on May 29 , 1966 , during an address at Howard University : `` To demand these God-given rights is to seek black power . `` [ 12 ] The first popular use of the term `` black power '' as a political and racial slogan was by Stokely Carmichael ( later known as Kwame Ture ) and Willie Ricks ( later known as Mukasa Dada ) , both organizers and spokespersons for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee ( SNCC ) .

It is a call for black people to define their own goals , to lead their own organizations . `` [ 21 ] Variants Black power adherents believed in black autonomy , with a variety of tendencies such as black nationalism , black self-determination , and black separatism .
